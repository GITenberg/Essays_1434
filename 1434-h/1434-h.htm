<h2>CERES&rsquo; RUNAWAY</h2>
<p>One can hardly be dull possessing the pleasant imaginary picture
of a Municipality hot in chase of a wild crop&mdash;at least while the
charming quarry escapes, as it does in Rome.&nbsp; The Municipality
does not exist that would be nimble enough to overtake the Roman growth
of green in the high places of the city.&nbsp; It is true that there
have been the famous captures&mdash;those in the Colosseum, and in the
Baths of Caracalla; moreover a less conspicuous running to earth takes
place on the Appian Way, in some miles of the solitude of the Campagna,
where men are employed in weeding the roadside.&nbsp; They slowly uproot
the grass and lay it on the ancient stones&mdash;rows of little corpses&mdash;for
sweeping up, as at Upper Tooting; one wonders why.&nbsp; The governors
of the city will not succeed in making the Via Appia look busy, or its
stripped stones suggestive of a thriving commerce.&nbsp; Again, at the
cemetery within the now torn and shattered Aurelian wall by the Porta
San Paolo, they are often mowing of buttercups.&nbsp; &ldquo;A light
of laughing flowers along the grass is spread,&rdquo; says Shelley,
whose child lies between Keats and the pyramid.&nbsp; But a couple of
active scythes are kept at work there summer and spring&mdash;not that
the grass is long, for it is much overtopped by the bee-orchis, but
because flowers are not to laugh within reach of the civic vigilance.</p>
<p>Yet, except that it is overtaken and put to death in these accessible
places, the wild summer growth of Rome has a prevailing success and
victory.&nbsp; It breaks all bounds, flies to the summits, lodges in
the sun, swings in the wind, takes wing to find the remotest ledges,
and blooms aloft.&nbsp; It makes light of the sixteenth century, of
the seventeenth, and of the eighteenth.&nbsp; As the historic ages grow
cold it banters them alike.&nbsp; The flagrant flourishing statue, the
haughty fa&ccedil;ade, the broken pediment (and Rome is chiefly the
city of the broken pediment) are the opportunities of this vagrant garden
in the air.&nbsp; One certain church, that is full of attitude, can
hardly be aware that a crimson snapdragon of great stature and many
stalks and blossoms is standing on its furthest summit tiptoe against
its sky.&nbsp; The cornice of another church in the fair middle of Rome
lifts out of the shadows of the streets a row of accidental marigolds.&nbsp;
Impartial to the antique, the mediaeval, the Renaissance early and late,
the newer modern, this wild summer finds its account in travertine and
tufa, reticulated work, brick, stucco and stone.&nbsp; &ldquo;A bird
of the air carries the matter,&rdquo; or the last sea-wind, sombre and
soft, or the latest tramontana, gold and blue, has lodged in a little
fertile dust the wild grass, wild wheat, wild oats!</p>
<p>If Venus had her runaway, after whom the Elizabethans raised hue
and cry, this is Ceres&rsquo;.&nbsp; The municipal authorities, hot-foot,
cannot catch it.&nbsp; And, worse than all, if they pause, dismayed,
to mark the flight of the agile fugitive safe on the arc of a flying
buttress, or taking the place of the fallen mosaics and coloured tiles
of a twelfth-century tower, and in any case inaccessible, the grass
grows under their discomfited feet.&nbsp; It actually casts a flush
of green over their city <i>piazza</i>&mdash;the wide light-grey pavements
so vast that to keep them weeded would need an army of workers.&nbsp;
That army has not been employed; and grass grows in a small way, but
still beautifully, in the wide space around which the tramway circles.&nbsp;
Perhaps a hatred of its delightful presence is what chiefly prompts
the civic government in Rome to the effort to turn the <i>piazza</i>
into a square.&nbsp; The shrub is to take the place not so much of the
pavement as of the importunate grass.&nbsp; For it is hard to be beaten&mdash;and
the weed does so prevail, is so small, and so dominant!&nbsp; The sun
takes its part, and one might almost imagine a sensitive Municipality
in tears, to see grass running, overhead and underfoot, through the
&ldquo;third&rdquo; (which is in truth the fourth) Rome.</p>
<p>When I say grass I use the word widely.&nbsp; Italian grass is not
turf; it is full of things, and they are chiefly aromatic.&nbsp; No
richer scents throng each other, close and warm, than these from a little
hand-space of the grass one rests on, within the walls or on the plain,
or in the Sabine or the Alban hills.&nbsp; Moreover, under the name
I will take leave to include lettuce as it grows with a most welcome
surprise on certain ledges of the Vatican.&nbsp; That great and beautiful
palace is piled, at various angles, as it were house upon house, here
magnificent, here careless, but with nothing pretentious and nothing
furtive.&nbsp; And outside one lateral window on a ledge to the sun,
prospers this little garden of random salad.&nbsp; Buckingham Palace
has nothing whatever of the Vatican dignity, but one cannot well think
of little cheerful cabbages sunning themselves on any parapet it may
have round a corner.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Italy the vegetables&mdash;the table ones&mdash;have
a wildness, a suggestion of the grass, from lands at liberty for all
the tilling.&nbsp; Wildish peas, wilder asparagus&mdash;the field asparagus
which seems to have disappeared from England, but of which Herrick boasts
in his manifestations of frugality&mdash;and strawberries much less
than half-way from the small and darkling ones of the woods to the pale
and corpulent of the gardens, and with nothing of the wild fragrance
lost&mdash;these are all Italian things of savage savour and simplicity.&nbsp;
The most cultivated of all countries, the Italy of tillage, is yet not
a garden, but something better, as her city is yet not a town but something
better, and her wilderness something better than a desert.&nbsp; In
all the three there is a trace of the little flying heels of the runaway.</p>
<h2>WELLS</h2>
<p>The world at present is inclined to make sorry mysteries or unattractive
secrets of the methods and supplies of the fresh and perennial means
of life.&nbsp; A very dull secret is made of water, for example, and
the plumber sets his seal upon the floods whereby we live.&nbsp; They
are covered, they are carried, they are hushed, from the spring to the
tap; and when their voices are released at last in the London scullery,
why, it can hardly be said that the song is eloquent of the natural
source of waters, whether earthly or heavenly.&nbsp; There is not one
of the circumstances of this capture of streams&mdash;the company, the
water-rate, and the rest&mdash;that is not a sign of the ill-luck of
modern devices in regard to style.&nbsp; For style implies a candour
and simplicity of means, an action, a gesture, as it were, in the doing
of small things; it is the ignorance of secret ways; whereas the finish
of modern life and its neatness seem to be secured by a system of little
shufflings and surprises.</p>
<p>Dress, among other things, is furnished throughout with such fittings;
they form its very construction.&nbsp; Style does not exist in modern
arrayings, for all their prettiness and precision, and for all the successes&mdash;which
are not to be denied&mdash;of their outer part; the happy little swagger
that simulates style is but another sign of its absence, being prepared
by mere dodges and dexterities beneath, and the triumph and success
of the present art of raiment&mdash;&ldquo;fit&rdquo; itself&mdash;is
but the result of a masked and lurking labour and device.</p>
<p>The masters of fine manners, moreover, seem to be always aware of
the beauty that comes of pausing slightly upon the smaller and slighter
actions, such as meaner men are apt to hurry out of the way.&nbsp; In
a word, the workman, with his finish and accomplishment, is the dexterous
provider of contemporary things; and the ready, well-appointed, and
decorated life of all towns is now altogether in his hands; whereas
the artist craftsman of other times made a manifestation of his means.&nbsp;
The first hides the streams, under stress and pressure, in paltry pipes
which we all must make haste to call upon the earth to cover, and the
second lifted up the arches of the aqueduct.</p>
<p>The search of easy ways to live is not always or everywhere the way
to ugliness, but in some countries, at some dates, it is the sure way.&nbsp;
In all countries, and at all dates, extreme finish compassed by hidden
means must needs, from the beginning, prepare the abolition of dignity.&nbsp;
This is easy to understand, but it is less easy to explain the ill-fortune
that presses upon the expert workman, in search of easy ways to live,
all the ill-favoured materials, makes them cheap for him, makes them
serviceable and effectual, urges him to use them, seal them, and inter
them, turning the trim and dull completeness out to the view of the
daily world.&nbsp; It is an added mischance.&nbsp; Nor, on the other
hand, is it easy to explain the beautiful good luck attending the simpler
devices which are, after all, only less expert ways of labour.&nbsp;
In those happy conditions, neither from the material, suggesting to
the workman, nor from the workman looking askance at his unhandsome
material, comes a first proposal to pour in cement and make fast the
underworld, out of sight.&nbsp; But fate spares not that suggestion
to the able and the unlucky at their task of making neat work of the
means, the distribution, the traffick of life.</p>
<p>The springs, then, the profound wells, the streams, are of all the
means of our lives those which we should wish to see open to the sun,
with their waters on their progress and their way to us; but, no, they
are lapped in lead.</p>
<p>King Pandion and his friends lie not under heavier seals.</p>
<p>Yet we have been delighted, elsewhere, by open floods.&nbsp; The
hiding-place that nature and the simpler crafts allot to the waters
of wells are, at their deepest, in communication with the open sky.&nbsp;
No other mine is so visited; for the noonday sun himself is visible
there; and it is fine to think of the waters of this planet, shallow
and profound, all charged with shining suns, a multitude of waters multiplying
suns, and carrying that remote fire, as it were, within their unalterable
freshness.&nbsp; Not a pool without this visitant, or without passages
of stars.&nbsp; As for the wells of the Equator, you may think of them
in their last recesses as the daily bathing-places of light; a luminous
fancy is able so to scatter fitful figures of the sun, and to plunge
them in thousands within those deeps.</p>
<p>Round images lie in the dark waters, but in the bright waters the
sun is shattered out of its circle, scattered into waves, broken across
stones, and rippled over sand; and in the shallow rivers that fall through
chestnut woods the image is mingled with the mobile figures of leaves.&nbsp;
To all these waters the agile air has perpetual access.&nbsp; Not so
can great towns be watered, it will be said with reason; and this is
precisely the ill-luck of great towns.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are towns, not, in a sense, so great, that have
the grace of visible wells; such as Venice, where every <i>campo</i>
has its circle of carved stone, its clashing of dark copper on the pavement,
its soft kiss of the copper vessel with the surface of the water below,
and the cheerful work of the cable.</p>
<p>Or the Romans knew how to cause the parted floods to measure their
plain with the strong, steady, and level flight of arches from the watersheds
in the hills to the and city; and having the waters captive, they knew
how to compel them to take part, by fountains, in this Roman triumph.&nbsp;
They had the wit to boast thus of their brilliant prisoner.</p>
<p>None more splendid came bound to Rome, or graced captivity with a
more invincible liberty of the heart.&nbsp; And the captivity and the
leap of the heart of the waters have outlived their captors.&nbsp; They
have remained in Rome, and have remained alone.&nbsp; Over them the
victory was longer than empire, and their thousands of loud voices have
never ceased to confess the conquest of the cold floods, separated long
ago, drawn one by one, alive, to the head and front of the world.</p>
<p>Of such a transit is made no secret.&nbsp; It was the most manifest
fact of Rome.&nbsp; You could not look to the city from the mountains
or to the distance from the city without seeing the approach of those
perpetual waters&mdash;waters bound upon daily tasks and minute services.&nbsp;
This, then, was the style of a master, who does not lapse from &ldquo;incidental
greatness,&rdquo; has no mean precision, out of sight, to prepare the
finish of his phrases, and does not think the means and the approaches
are to be plotted and concealed.&nbsp; Without anxiety, without haste,
and without misgiving are all great things to be done, and neither interruption
in the doing nor ruin after they are done finds anything in them to
betray.&nbsp; There was never any disgrace of means, and when the world
sees the work broken through there is no disgrace of discovery.&nbsp;
The labour of Michelangelo&rsquo;s chisel, little more than begun, a
Roman structure long exposed in disarray&mdash;upon these the light
of day looks full, and the Roman and the Florentine have their unrefuted
praise.</p>
<h2>RAIN</h2>
<p>Not excepting the falling stars&mdash;for they are far less sudden&mdash;there
is nothing in nature that so outstrips our unready eyes as the familiar
rain.&nbsp; The rods that thinly stripe our landscape, long shafts from
the clouds, if we had but agility to make the arrowy downward journey
with them by the glancing of our eyes, would be infinitely separate,
units, an innumerable flight of single things, and the simple movement
of intricate points.</p>
<p>The long stroke of the raindrop, which is the drop and its path at
once, being our impression of a shower, shows us how certainly our impression
is the effect of the lagging, and not of the haste, of our senses.&nbsp;
What we are apt to call our quick impression is rather our sensibly
tardy, unprepared, surprised, outrun, lightly bewildered sense of things
that flash and fall, wink, and are overpast and renewed, while the gentle
eyes of man hesitate and mingle the beginning with the close.&nbsp;
These inexpert eyes, delicately baffled, detain for an instant the image
that puzzles them, and so dally with the bright progress of a meteor,
and part slowly from the slender course of the already fallen raindrop,
whose moments are not theirs.&nbsp; There seems to be such a difference
of instants as invests all swift movement with mystery in man&rsquo;s
eyes, and causes the past, a moment old, to be written, vanishing, upon
the skies.</p>
<p>The visible world is etched and engraved with the signs and records
of our halting apprehension; and the pause between the distant woodman&rsquo;s
stroke with the axe and its sound upon our ears is repeated in the impressions
of our clinging sight.&nbsp; The round wheel dazzles it, and the stroke
of the bird&rsquo;s wing shakes it off like a captivity evaded.&nbsp;
Everywhere the natural haste is impatient of these timid senses; and
their perception, outrun by the shower, shaken by the light, denied
by the shadow, eluded by the distance, makes the lingering picture that
is all our art.&nbsp; One of the most constant causes of all the mystery
and beauty of that art is surely not that we see by flashes, but that
nature flashes on our meditative eyes.&nbsp; There is no need for the
impressionist to make haste, nor would haste avail him, for mobile nature
doubles upon him, and plays with his delays the exquisite game of visibility.</p>
<p>Momently visible in a shower, invisible within the earth, the ministration
of water is so manifest in the coming rain-cloud that the husbandman
is allowed to see the rain of his own land, yet unclaimed in the arms
of the rainy wind.&nbsp; It is an eager lien that he binds the shower
withal, and the grasp of his anxiety is on the coming cloud.&nbsp; His
sense of property takes aim and reckons distance and speed, and even
as he shoots a little ahead of the equally uncertain ground-game, he
knows approximately how to hit the cloud of his possession.&nbsp; So
much is the rain bound to the earth that, unable to compel it, man has
yet found a way, by lying in wait, to put his price upon it.&nbsp; The
exhaustible cloud &ldquo;outweeps its rain,&rdquo; and only the inexhaustible
sun seems to repeat and to enforce his cumulative fires upon every span
of ground, innumerable.&nbsp; The rain is wasted upon the sea, but only
by a fantasy can the sun&rsquo;s waste be made a reproach to the ocean,
the desert, or the sealed-up street.&nbsp; Rossetti&rsquo;s &ldquo;vain
virtues&rdquo; are the virtues of the rain, falling unfruitfully.</p>
<p>Baby of the cloud, rain is carried long enough within that troubled
breast to make all the multitude of days unlike each other.&nbsp; Rain,
as the end of the cloud, divides light and withholds it; in its flight
warning away the sun, and in its final fall dismissing shadow.&nbsp;
It is a threat and a reconciliation; it removes mountains compared with
which the Alps are hillocks, and makes a childlike peace between opposed
heights and battlements of heaven.</p>
<h2>THE TOW PATH</h2>
<p>A childish pleasure in producing small mechanical effects unaided
must have some part in the sense of enterprise wherewith you gird your
shoulders with the tackle, and set out, alone but necessary, on the
even path of the lopped and grassy side of the Thames&mdash;the side
of meadows.</p>
<p>The elastic resistance of the line is a &ldquo;heart-animating strain,&rdquo;
only too slight; and sensible is the thrill in it as the ranks of the
riverside plants, with their small summit-flower of violet-pink, are
swept aside like a long green breaker of flourishing green.&nbsp; The
line drums lightly in the ears when the bushes are high and it grows
taut; it makes a telephone for the rush of flowers under the stress
of your easy power.</p>
<p>The active delights of one who is not athletic are few, like the
joys of &ldquo;feeling hearts&rdquo; according to the erroneous sentiment
of a verse of Moore&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The joys of sensitive hearts are
many; but the joys of sensitive hands are few.&nbsp; Here, however,
in the effectual act of towing, is the ample revenge of the unmuscular
upon the happy labourers with the oar, the pole, the bicycle, and all
other means of violence.&nbsp; Here, on the long tow-path, between warm,
embrowned meadows and opal waters, you need but to walk in your swinging
harness, and so take your friends up-stream.</p>
<p>You work merely as the mill-stream works&mdash;by simple movement.&nbsp;
At lock after lock along a hundred miles, deep-roofed mills shake to
the wheel that turns by no greater stress, and you and the river have
the same mere force of progress.</p>
<p>There never was any kinder incentive of companionship.&nbsp; It is
the bright Thames walking softly in your blood, or you that are flowing
by so many curves of low shore on the level of the world.</p>
<p>Now you are over against the shadows, and now opposite the sun, as
the wheeling river makes the sky wheel about your head and swings the
lighted clouds or the blue to face your eyes.&nbsp; The birds, flying
high for mountain air in the heat, wing nothing but their own weight.&nbsp;
You will not envy them for so brief a success.&nbsp; Did not Wordsworth
want a &ldquo;little boat&rdquo; for the air?&nbsp; Did not Byron call
him a blockhead therefor?&nbsp; Wordsworth had, perhaps, a sense of
towing.</p>
<p>All the advantage of the expert is nothing in this simple industry.&nbsp;
Even the athlete, though he may go further, cannot do better than you,
walking your effectual walk with the line attached to your willing steps.&nbsp;
Your moderate strength of a mere everyday physical education gives you
the sufficient mastery of the tow-path.</p>
<p>If your natural walk is heavy, there is spirit in the tackle to give
it life, and if it is buoyant it will be more buoyant under the buoyant
burden&mdash;the yielding check&mdash;than ever before.&nbsp; An unharnessed
walk must begin to seem to you a sorry incident of insignificant liberty.&nbsp;
It is easier than towing?&nbsp; So is the drawing of water in a sieve
easier to the arms than drawing in a bucket, but not to the heart.</p>
<p>To walk unbound is to walk in prose, without the friction of the
wings of metre, without the sweet and encouraging tug upon the spirit
and the line.</p>
<p>No dead weight follows you as you tow.&nbsp; The burden is willing;
it depends upon you gaily, as a friend may do without making any depressing
show of helplessness; neither, on the other hand, is it apt to set you
at naught or charge you with a make-believe.&nbsp; It accompanies, it
almost anticipates; it lags when you are brisk, just so much as to give
your briskness good reason, and to justify you if you should take to
still more nimble heels.&nbsp; All your haste, moreover, does but waken
a more brilliantly-sounding ripple.</p>
<p>The bounding and rebounding burden you carry (but it nearly seems
to carry you, so fine is the mutual good will) gives work to your figure,
enlists your erectness and your gait, but leaves your eyes free.&nbsp;
No watching of mechanisms for the labourer of the tow-path.&nbsp; What
little outlook is to be kept falls to the lot of the steerer smoothly
towed.&nbsp; Your easy and efficient work lets you carry your head high
and watch the birds, or listen to them.&nbsp; They fly in such lofty
air that they seem to turn blue in the blue sky.&nbsp; A flash of their
flight shows silver for a moment, but they are blue birds in that sunny
distance above, as mountains are blue, and horizons.&nbsp; The days
are so still that you do not merely hear the cawing of the rooks&mdash;you
overhear their hundred private croakings and creakings, the soliloquy
of the solitary places swept by wings.</p>
<p>As for songs, it is September, and the silence of July is long at
an end.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s robins are in full voice; and the only
song that is not for love or nesting&mdash;the childish song of boy-birds,
the freshest and youngest note&mdash;is, by a happy paradox, that of
an autumnal voice.</p>
<p>Here is no hoot, nor hurry of engines, nor whisper of the cyclist&rsquo;s
wheel, nor foot upon a road, to overcome that light but resounding note.&nbsp;
Silent are feet on the grassy brink, like the innocent, stealthy soles
of the barefooted in the south.</p>
<h2>THE TETHERED CONSTELLATIONS</h2>
<p>It is no small thing&mdash;no light discovery&mdash;to find a river
Andromeda and Arcturus and their bright neighbours wheeling for half
a summer night around a pole-star in the waters.&nbsp; One star or two&mdash;delicate
visitants of streams&mdash;we are used to see, somewhat by a sleight
of the eyes, so fine and so fleeting is that apparition.&nbsp; Or the
southern waves may show the light&mdash;not the image&mdash;of the evening
or the morning planet.&nbsp; But this, in a pool of the country Thames
at night, is no ripple-lengthened light; it is the startling image of
a whole large constellation burning in the flood.</p>
<p>These reflected heavens are different heavens.&nbsp; On a darker
and more vacant field than that of the real skies, the shape of the
Lyre or the Bear has an altogether new and noble solitude; and the waters
play a painter&rsquo;s part in setting their splendid subject free.&nbsp;
Two movements shake but do not scatter the still night: the bright flashing
of constellations in the deep Weir-pool, and the dark flashes of the
vague bats flying.&nbsp; The stars in the stream fluctuate with an alien
motion.&nbsp; Reversed, estranged, isolated, every shape of large stars
escapes and returns, escapes and returns.&nbsp; Fitful in the steady
night, those constellations, so few, so whole, and so remote, have a
suddenness of gleaming life.&nbsp; You imagine that some unexampled
gale might make them seem to shine with such a movement in the veritable
sky; yet nothing but deep water, seeming still in its incessant flight
and rebound, could really show such altered stars.&nbsp; The flood lets
a constellation fly, as Juliet&rsquo;s &ldquo;wanton&rdquo; with a tethered
bird, only to pluck it home again.&nbsp; At moments some rhythmic flux
of the water seems about to leave the darkly-set, widely-spaced Bear
absolutely at large, to dismiss the great stars, and refuse to imitate
the skies, and all the water is obscure; then one broken star returns,
then fragments of another, and a third and a fourth flit back to their
noble places, brilliantly vague, wonderfully visible, mobile, and unalterable.&nbsp;
There is nothing else at once so keen and so elusive.</p>
<p>The aspen poplar had been in captive flight all day, but with no
such vanishings as these.&nbsp; The dimmer constellations of the soft
night are reserved by the skies.&nbsp; Hardly is a secondary star seen
by the large and vague eyes of the stream.&nbsp; They are blind to the
Pleiades.</p>
<p>There is a little kind of star that drowns itself by hundreds in
the river Thames&mdash;the many-rayed silver-white seed that makes journeys
on all the winds up and down England and across it in the end of summer.&nbsp;
It is a most expert traveller, turning a little wheel a-tiptoe wherever
the wind lets it rest, and speeding on those pretty points when it is
not flying.&nbsp; The streets of London are among its many highways,
for it is fragile enough to go far in all sorts of weather.&nbsp; But
it gets disabled if a rough gust tumbles it on the water so that its
finely-feathered feet are wet.&nbsp; On gentle breezes it is able to
cross dry-shod, walking the waters.</p>
<p>All unlike is this pilgrim star to the tethered constellations.&nbsp;
It is far adrift.&nbsp; It goes singly to all the winds.&nbsp; It offers
thistle plants (or whatever is the flower that makes such delicate ashes)
to the tops of many thousand hills.&nbsp; Doubtless the farmer would
rather have to meet it in battalions than in these invincible units
astray.&nbsp; But if the farmer owes it a lawful grudge, there is many
a rigid riverside garden wherein it would be a great pleasure to sow
the thistles of the nearest pasture.</p>
<h2>RUSHES AND REEDS</h2>
<p>Taller than the grass and lower than the trees, there is another
growth that feels the implicit spring.&nbsp; It had been more abandoned
to winter than even the short grass shuddering under a wave of east
wind, more than the dumb trees.&nbsp; For the multitudes of sedges,
rushes, canes, and reeds were the appropriate lyre of the cold.&nbsp;
On them the nimble winds played their dry music.&nbsp; They were part
of the winter.&nbsp; It looked through them and spoke through them.&nbsp;
They were spears and javelins in array to the sound of the drums of
the north.</p>
<p>The winter takes fuller possession of these things than of those
that stand solid.&nbsp; The sedges whistle his tune.&nbsp; They let
the colour of his light look through&mdash;low-flying arrows and bright
bayonets of winter day.</p>
<p>The multitudes of all reeds and rushes grow out of bounds.&nbsp;
They belong to the margins of lands, the space between the farms and
the river, beyond the pastures, and where the marsh in flower becomes
perilous footing for the cattle.&nbsp; They are the fringe of the low
lands, the sign of streams.&nbsp; They grow tall between you and the
near horizon of flat lands.&nbsp; They etch their sharp lines upon the
sky; and near them grow flowers of stature, including the lofty yellow
lily.</p>
<p>Our green country is the better for the grey, soft, cloudy darkness
of the sedge, and our full landscape is the better for the distinction
of its points, its needles, and its resolute right lines.</p>
<p>Ours is a summer full of voices, and therefore it does not so need
the sound of rushes; but they are most sensitive to the stealthy breezes,
and betray the passing of a wind that even the tree-tops knew not of.&nbsp;
Sometimes it is a breeze unfelt, but the stiff sedges whisper it along
a mile of marsh.&nbsp; To the strong wind they bend, showing the silver
of their sombre little tassels as fish show the silver of their sides
turning in the pathless sea.&nbsp; They are unanimous.&nbsp; A field
of tall flowers tosses many ways in one warm gale, like the many lovers
of a poet who have a thousand reasons for their love; but the rushes,
more strongly tethered, are swept into a single attitude, again and
again, at every renewal of the storm.</p>
<p>Between the pasture and the wave, the many miles of rushes and reeds
in England seem to escape that insistent ownership which has so changed
(except for a few forests and downs) the aspect of England, and has
in fact made the landscape.&nbsp; Cultivation makes the landscape elsewhere,
rather than ownership, for the boundaries in the south are not conspicuous;
but here it is ownership.&nbsp; But the rushes are a gipsy people, amongst
us, yet out of reach.&nbsp; The landowner, if he is rather a gross man,
believes these races of reeds are his.&nbsp; But if he is a man of sensibility,
depend upon it he has his interior doubts.&nbsp; His property, he says,
goes right down to the centre of the earth, in the shape of a wedge;
how high up it goes into the air it would be difficult to say, and obviously
the shape of the wedge must be continued in the direction of increase.&nbsp;
We may therefore proclaim his right to the clouds and their cargo.&nbsp;
It is true that as his ground game is apt to go upon his neighbour&rsquo;s
land to be shot, so the clouds may now and then spend his showers elsewhere.&nbsp;
But the great thing is the view.&nbsp; A well-appointed country-house
sees nothing out of the windows that is not its own.&nbsp; But he who
tells you so, and proves it to you by his own view, is certainly disturbed
by an unspoken doubt, if his otherwise contented eyes should happen
to be caught by a region of rushes.&nbsp; The water is his&mdash;he
had the pond made; or the river, for a space, and the fish, for a time.&nbsp;
But the bulrushes, the reeds!&nbsp; One wonders whether a very thorough
landowner, but a sensitive one, ever resolved that he would endure this
sort of thing no longer, and went out armed and had a long acre of sedges
scythed to death.</p>
<p>They are probably outlaws.&nbsp; They are dwellers upon thresholds
and upon margins, as the gipsies make a home upon the green edges of
a road.&nbsp; No wild flowers, however wild, are rebels.&nbsp; The copses
and their primroses are good subjects, the oaks are loyal.&nbsp; Now
and then, though, one has a kind of suspicion of some of the other kinds
of trees&mdash;the Corot trees.&nbsp; Standing at a distance from the
more ornamental trees, from those of fuller foliage, and from all the
indeciduous shrubs and the conifers (manifest property, every one),
two or three translucent aspens, with which the very sun and the breath
of earth are entangled, have sometimes seemed to wear a certain look&mdash;an
extra-territorial look, let us call it.&nbsp; They are suspect.&nbsp;
One is inclined to shake a doubtful head at them.</p>
<p>And the landowner feels it.&nbsp; He knows quite well, though he
may not say so, that the Corot trees, though they do not dwell upon
margins, are in spirit almost as extra-territorial as the rushes.&nbsp;
In proof of this he very often cuts them down, out of the view, once
for all.&nbsp; The view is better, as a view, without them.&nbsp; Though
their roots are in his ground right enough, there is a something about
their heads&mdash;.&nbsp; But the reason he gives for wishing them away
is merely that they are &ldquo;thin.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man does not always
say everything.</p>
<h2>A NORTHERN FANCY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Dryden, writing to Dennis, &ldquo;I
remember poor Nat Lee, who was then upon the verge of madness, yet made
a sober and witty answer to a bad poet who told him, &lsquo;It was an
easy thing to write like a madman.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis a very difficult thing to write like a madman,
but &rsquo;tis a very easy thing to write like a fool.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the difficult song of distraction is to be heard, a light
high note, in English poetry throughout two centuries at least, and
one English poet lately set that untethered lyric, the mad maid&rsquo;s
song, flying again.</p>
<p>A revolt against the oppression of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries&mdash;the age of the re-discovery of death; against the crime
of tragedies; against the tyranny of Italian example that had made the
poets walk in one way of love, scorn, constancy, inconstancy&mdash;may
have caused this trolling of unconsciousness, this tune of innocence,
and this carol of liberty, to be held so dear.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard
a maid in Bedlam,&rdquo; runs the old song.&nbsp; High and low the poets
tried for that note, and the singer was nearly always to be a maid and
crazed for love.&nbsp; Except for the temporary insanity so indifferently
worn by the soprano of the now deceased kind of Italian opera, and except
that a recent French story plays with the flitting figure of a village
girl robbed of her wits by woe (and this, too, is a Russian villager,
and the Southern author may have found his story on the spot, as he
seems to aver) I have not met elsewhere than in England this solitary
and detached poetry of the treble note astray.</p>
<p>At least, it is principally a northern fancy.&nbsp; Would the steadfast
Cordelia, if she had not died, have lifted the low voice to that high
note, so delicately untuned?&nbsp; She who would not be prodigal of
words might yet, indeed, have sung in the cage, and told old tales,
and laughed at gilded butterflies of the court of crimes, and lived
so long in the strange health of an emancipated brain as to wear out</p>
<blockquote><p>Packs and sects of great ones<br />
That ebb and flow by the moon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She, if King Lear had had his last desire, might have sung the merry
and strange tune of Bedlam, like the slighter Ophelia and the maid called
Barbara.</p>
<p>It was surely the name of the maid who died singing, as Desdemona
remembers, that lingered in the ear of Wordsworth.&nbsp; Of all the
songs of the distracted, written in the sanity of high imagination,
there is nothing more passionate than that beginning &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
said that some have died for love.&rdquo;&nbsp; To one who has always
recognized the greatness of this poem and who possibly had known and
forgotten how much Ruskin prized it, it was a pleasure to find the judgement
afresh in <i>Modern</i> <i>Painters</i>, where this grave lyric is cited
for an example of great imagination.&nbsp; It is the mourning and restless
song of the lover (&ldquo;the pretty Barbara died&rdquo;) who has not
yet broken free from memory into the alien world of the insane.</p>
<p>Barbara&rsquo;s lover dwelt in the scene of his love, as Dryden&rsquo;s
Adam entreats the expelling angel that he might do, protesting that
he could endure to lose &ldquo;the bliss, but not the place.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(And although this dramatic &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; of Dryden&rsquo;s
is hardly named by critics except to be scorned, this is assuredly a
fine and imaginative thought.)&nbsp; It is nevertheless as a wanderer
that the crazed creature visits the fancy of English poets with such
a wild recurrence.&nbsp; The Englishman of the far past, barred by climate,
bad roads, ill-lighted winters, and the intricate life and customs of
the little town, must have been generally a home-keeper.&nbsp; No adventure,
no setting forth, and small liberty, for him.&nbsp; But Tom-a-Bedlam,
the wild man in patches or in ribbons, with his wallet and his horn
for alms of food or drink, came and went as fitfully as the storm, free
to suffer all the cold&mdash;an unsheltered creature; and the chill
fancy of the villager followed him out to the heath on a journey that
had no law.&nbsp; Was it he in person, or a poet for him, that made
the swinging song: &ldquo;From the hag and the hungry goblin&rdquo;?&nbsp;
If a poet, it was one who wrote like a madman and not like a fool.</p>
<p>Not a town, not a village, not a solitary cottage during the English
Middle Ages was unvisited by him who frightened the children; they had
a name for him as for the wild birds&mdash;Robin Redbreast, Dicky Swallow,
Philip Sparrow, Tom Tit, Tom-a-Bedlam.&nbsp; And after him came the
&ldquo;Abram men,&rdquo; who were sane parodies of the crazed, and went
to the fairs and wakes in motley.&nbsp; Evelyn says of a fop: &ldquo;All
his body was dressed like a maypole, or a Tom-a-Bedlam&rsquo;s cap.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But after the Civil Wars they vanished, and no man knew how.&nbsp; In
time old men remembered them only to remember that they had not seen
any such companies or solitary wanderers of late years.</p>
<p>The mad maid of the poets is a vagrant too, when she is free, and
not singing within Bedlam early in the morning, &ldquo;in the spring.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Wordsworth, who dealt with the legendary fancy in his &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo;
makes the crazed one a wanderer in the hills whom a traveller might
see by chance, rare as an Oread, and nearly as wild as Echo herself:-</p>
<blockquote><p>I too have passed her in the hills<br />
Setting her little water-mills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His heart misgives him to think of the rheumatism that must befall
in such a way of living; and his grave sense of civilization, <i>bourgeois</i>
in the humane and noble way that is his own, restores her after death
to the company of man, to the &ldquo;holy bell,&rdquo; which Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Duke remembered in banishment, and to the congregation and their &ldquo;Christian
psalm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older poets were less responsible, less serious and more sad,
than Wordsworth, when they in turn were touched by the fancy of the
maid crazed by love.&nbsp; They left her to her light immortality; and
she might be drenched in dews; they would not desire to reconcile nor
bury her.&nbsp; She might have her hair torn by the bramble, but her
heart was light after trouble.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many light hearts and wings&rdquo;&mdash;she
had at least the bird&rsquo;s heart, and the poet lent to her voice
the wings of his verses.</p>
<p>There is nothing in our poetry less modern than she.&nbsp; The vagrant
woman of later feeling was rather the sane creature of Ebenezer Elliott&rsquo;s
fine lines in &ldquo;The Excursion&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bone-weary, many-childed, trouble-tried!<br />
Wife of my bosom, wedded to my soul!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trouble did not &ldquo;try&rdquo; the Elizabethan wild one, it undid
her.&nbsp; She had no child, or if there had ever been a child of hers,
she had long forgotten how it died.&nbsp; She hailed the wayfarer, who
was more weary than she, with a song; she haunted the cheerful dawn;
her &ldquo;good-morrow&rdquo; rings from Herrick&rsquo;s poem, fresh
as cock-crow.&nbsp; She knows that her love is dead, and her perplexity
has regard rather to the many kinds of flowers than to the old story
of his death; they distract her in the splendid meadows.</p>
<p>All the tragic world paused to hear that lightest of songs, as the
tragedy of Hamlet pauses for the fitful voice of Ophelia.&nbsp; Strange
was the charm of this perpetual alien, and unknown to us now.&nbsp;
The world has become once again as it was in the mad maid&rsquo;s heyday,
less serious and more sad than Wordsworth; but it has not recovered,
and perhaps will never recover, that sweetness.&nbsp; Blake&rsquo;s
was a more starry madness.&nbsp; Crabbe, writing of village sorrows,
thought himself bound to recur to the legend of the mad maid, but his
&ldquo;crazed maiden&rdquo; is sane enough, sorrowful but dull, and
sings of her own &ldquo;burning brow,&rdquo; as Herrick&rsquo;s wild
one never sang; nor is there any smile in her story, though she talks
of flowers, or, rather, &ldquo;the herbs I loved to rear&rdquo;; and
perhaps she is the surest of all signs that the strange inspiration
of the past centuries was lost, vanished like Tom-a-Bedlam himself.&nbsp;
It had been wholly English, whereas the English eighteenth century was
not wholly English.</p>
<p>It is not to be imagined that any hard Southern mind could ever have
played in poetry with such a fancy; or that Petrarch, for example, could
so have foregone the manifestation of intelligence and intelligible
sentiment.&nbsp; And as to Dante, who put the two eternities into the
momentary balance of the human will, cold would be his disregard of
this northern dream of innocence.&nbsp; If the mad maid was an alien
upon earth, what were she in the Inferno?&nbsp; What word can express
her strangeness there, her vagrancy there?&nbsp; And with what eyes
would they see this dewy face glancing in at the windows of that City?</p>
<h2>PATHOS</h2>
<p>A fugitive writer wrote not long ago on the fugitive page of a magazine:
&ldquo;For our part, the drunken tinker [Christopher Sly] is the most
real personage of the piece, and not without some hints of the pathos
that is worked out more fully, though by different ways, in Bottom and
Malvolio.&rdquo;&nbsp; Has it indeed come to this?&nbsp; Have the Zeitgeist
and the Weltschmerz or their yet later equivalents, compared with which
&ldquo;le spleen&rdquo; of the French Byronic age was gay, done so much
for us?&nbsp; Is there to be no laughter left in literature free from
the preoccupation of a sham real-life?&nbsp; So it would seem.&nbsp;
Even what the great master has not shown us in his work, that your critic
convinced of pathos is resolved to see in it.&nbsp; By the penetration
of his intrusive sympathy he will come at it.&nbsp; It is of little
use now to explain Snug the joiner to the audience: why, it is precisely
Snug who stirs their emotions so painfully.&nbsp; Not the lion; they
can make shift to see through that: but the Snug within, the human Snug.&nbsp;
And Master Shallow has the Weltschmerz in that latent form which is
the more appealing; and discouraging questions arise as to the end of
old Double; and Harpagon is the tragic figure of Monomania; and as to
Argan, ah, what havoc in &ldquo;les entrailles de Monsieur&rdquo; must
have been wrought by those prescriptions!&nbsp; <i>Et</i> <i>patati</i>,
<i>et</i> <i>patata</i>.</p>
<p>It may be only too true that the actual world is &ldquo;with pathos
delicately edged.&rdquo;&nbsp; For Malvolio living we should have had
living sympathies; so much aspiration, so ill-educated a love of refinement;
so unarmed a credulity, noblest of weaknesses, betrayed for the laughter
of a chambermaid.&nbsp; By an actual Bottom the weaver our pity might
be reached for the sake of his single self-reliance, his fancy and resource
condemned to burlesque and ignominy by the niggard doom of circumstance.&nbsp;
But is not life one thing and is not art another?&nbsp; Is it not the
privilege of literature to treat things singly, without the after-thoughts
of life, without the troublous completeness of the many-sided world?&nbsp;
Is not Shakespeare, for this reason, our refuge?&nbsp; Fortunately unreal
is his world when he will have it so; and there we may laugh with open
heart at a grotesque man: without misgiving, without remorse, without
reluctance.&nbsp; If great creating Nature has not assumed for herself
she has assuredly secured to the great creating poet the right of partiality,
of limitation, of setting aside and leaving out, of taking one impression
and one emotion as sufficient for the day.&nbsp; Art and Nature are
complementary; in relation, not in confusion, with one another.&nbsp;
And all this officious cleverness in seeing round the corner, as it
were, of a thing presented by literary art in the flat&mdash;(the borrowing
of similes from other arts is of evil tendency; but let this pass, as
it is apt)&mdash;is but another sign of the general lack of a sense
of the separation between Nature and her sentient mirror in the mind.&nbsp;
In some of his persons, indeed, Shakespeare is as Nature herself, all-inclusive;
but in others&mdash;and chiefly in comedy&mdash;he is partial, he is
impressionary, he refuses to know what is not to his purpose, he is
light-heartedly capricious.&nbsp; And in that gay, wilful world it is
that he gives us&mdash;or used to give us, for even the word is obsolete&mdash;the
pleasure of <i>oubliance</i>.</p>
<p>Now this fugitive writer has not been so swift but that I have caught
him a clout as he went.&nbsp; Yet he will do it again; and those like-minded
will assuredly also continue to show how much more completely human,
how much more sensitive, how much more responsible, is the art of the
critic than the world has ever dreamt till now.&nbsp; And, superior
in so much, they will still count their importunate sensibility as the
choicest of their gifts.&nbsp; And Lepidus, who loves to wonder, can
have no better subject for his admiration than the pathos of the time.&nbsp;
It is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
a strange serpent; and the tears of it are wet.</p>
<h2>ANIMA PELLEGRINA!</h2>
<p>Every language in the world has its own phrase, fresh for the stranger&rsquo;s
fresh and alien sense of its signal significance; a phrase that is its
own essential possession, and yet is dearer to the speaker of other
tongues.&nbsp; Easily&mdash;shall I say cheaply?&mdash;spiritual, for
example, was the nation that devised the name <i>anima</i> <i>pellegrina</i>,
wherewith to crown a creature admired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pilgrim soul&rdquo;
is a phrase for any language, but &ldquo;pilgrim soul!&rdquo; addressed,
singly and sweetly to one who cannot be over-praised, &ldquo;pilgrim-soul!&rdquo;
is a phrase of fondness, the high homage of a lover, of one watching,
of one who has no more need of common flatteries, but has admired and
gazed while the object of his praises visibly surpassed them&mdash;this
is the facile Italian ecstasy, and it rises into an Italian heaven.</p>
<p>It was by chance, and in an old play, that I came upon this impetuous,
sudden, and single sentence of admiration, as it were a sentence of
life passed upon one charged with inestimable deeds; and the modern
editor had thought it necessary to explain the exclamation by a note.&nbsp;
It was, he said, poetical.</p>
<p><i>Anima</i> <i>pellegrina</i> seems to be Italian of no later date
than Pergolese&rsquo;s airs, and suits the time as the familiar phrase
of the more modern love-song suited the day of Bellini.&nbsp; But it
is only Italian, bygone Italian, and not a part of the sweet past of
any other European nation, but only of this.</p>
<p>To the same local boundaries and enclosed skies belongs the charm
of those buoyant words:-</p>
<blockquote><p>Felice chi vi mira,<br />
Ma pi&ugrave; felice chi per voi sospira!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is not only a charm of elastic sound or of grace; that would
be but a property of the turn of speech.&nbsp; It is rather the profounder
advantage whereby the rhymes are freighted with such feeling as the
very language keeps in store.&nbsp; In another tongue you may sing,
&ldquo;happy who looks, happier who sighs&rdquo;; but in what other
tongue shall the little meaning be so sufficient, and in what other
shall you get from so weak an antithesis the illusion of a lovely intellectual
epigram?&nbsp; Yet it is not worthy of an English reader to call it
an illusion; he should rather be glad to travel into the place of a
language where the phrase <i>is</i> intellectual, impassioned, and an
epigram; and should thankfully for the occasion translate himself, and
not the poetry.</p>
<p>I have been delighted to use a present current phrase whereof the
charm may still be unknown to Englishmen&mdash;&ldquo;<i>piuttosto</i>
<i>bruttini</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; See what an all-Italian spirit is here,
and what contempt, not reluctant, but tolerant and familiar.&nbsp; You
may hear it said of pictures, or works of art of several kinds, and
you confess at once that not otherwise should they be condemned.&nbsp;
<i>Brutto</i>&mdash;ugly&mdash;is the word of justice, the word for
any language, everywhere translatable, a circular note, to be exchanged
internationally with a general meaning, wholesale, in the course of
the European concert.&nbsp; But <i>bruttino</i> is a soothing diminutive,
a diminutive that forbears to express contempt, a diminutive that implies
innocence, and is, moreover, guarded by a hesitating adverb, shrugging
in the rear&mdash;&ldquo;rather than not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather
ugly than not, and ugly in a little way that we need say few words about&mdash;the
fewer the better;&rdquo; nay, this paraphrase cannot achieve the homely
Italian quality whereby the printed and condemnatory criticism is made
a family affair that shall go no further.&nbsp; After the sound of it,
the European concert seems to be composed of brass instruments.</p>
<p>How unlike is the house of English language and the enclosure into
which a traveller hither has to enter!&nbsp; Do we possess anything
here more essentially ours (though we share it with our sister Germany)
than our particle &ldquo;un&rdquo;?&nbsp; Poor are those living languages
that have not our use of so rich a negative.&nbsp; The French equivalent
in adjectives reaches no further than the adjective itself&mdash;or
hardly; it does not attain the participle; so that no French or Italian
poet has the words &ldquo;unloved&rdquo;, &ldquo;unforgiven.&rdquo;&nbsp;
None such, therefore, has the opportunity of the gravest and the most
majestic of all ironies.&nbsp; In our English, the words that are denied
are still there&mdash;&ldquo;loved,&rdquo; &ldquo;forgiven&rdquo;: excluded
angels, who stand erect, attesting what is not done, what is undone,
what shall not be done.</p>
<p>No merely opposite words could have so much denial, or so much pain
of loss, or so much outer darkness, or so much barred beatitude in sight.&nbsp;
All-present, all-significant, all-remembering, all-foretelling is the
word, and it has a plenitude of knowledge.</p>
<p>We have many more conspicuous possessions that are, like this, proper
to character and thought, and by no means only an accident of untransferable
speech.&nbsp; And it is impossible for a reader, who is a lover of languages
for their spirit, to pass the words of untravelled excellence, proper
to their own garden enclosed, without recognition.&nbsp; Never may they
be disregarded or confounded with the universal stock.&nbsp; If I would
not so neglect <i>piuttosto</i> <i>bruttini</i>, how much less a word
dominating literature!&nbsp; And of such words of ascendancy and race
there is no great English author but has abundant possession.&nbsp;
No need to recall them.&nbsp; But even writers who are not great have,
here and there, proved their full consciousness of their birthright.&nbsp;
Thus does a man who was hardly an author, Haydon the painter, put out
his hand to take his rights.&nbsp; He has incomparable language when
he is at a certain page of his life; at that time he sate down to sketch
his child, dying in its babyhood, and the head he studied was, he says,
full of &ldquo;power and grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a phrase of different discovery from that which reveals a
local rhyme-balanced epigram, a gracious antithesis, taking an intellectual
place&mdash;<i>Felice</i> <i>chi</i> <i>vi</i> <i>mira&mdash;</i>or
the art-critic&rsquo;s phrase&mdash;<i>piuttosto</i> <i>bruttini&mdash;</i>of
easy, companionable, and equal contempt.</p>
<p>As for French, if it had no other sacred words&mdash;and it has many&mdash;who
would not treasure the language that has given us&mdash;no, not that
has given us, but that has kept for its own&mdash;<i>ensoleill&egrave;</i>?&nbsp;
Nowhere else is the sun served with such a word.&nbsp; It is not to
be said or written without a convincing sense of sunshine, and from
the very word come light and radiation.&nbsp; The unaccustomed north
could not have made it, nor the accustomed south, but only a nation
part-north and part-south; therefore neither England nor Italy can rival
it.&nbsp; But there needed also the senses of the French&mdash;those
senses of which they say far too much in every second-class book of
their enormous, their general second-class, but which they have matched
in their time with some inimitable words.&nbsp; Perhaps that matching
was done at the moment of the full literary consciousness of the senses,
somewhere about the famous 1830.&nbsp; For I do not think <i>ensoleill&egrave;</i>
to be a much older word&mdash;I make no assertion.&nbsp; Whatever its
origin, may it have no end!&nbsp; They cannot weary us with it; for
it seems as new as the sun, as remote as old Provence; village, hill-side,
vineyard, and chestnut wood shine in the splendour of the word, the
air is light, and white things passing blind the eyes&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s
linen, white cattle, shining on the way from shadow to shadow.&nbsp;
A word of the sense of sight, and a summer word, in short, compared
with which the paraphrase is but a picture.&nbsp; For <i>ensoleill&egrave;</i>
I would claim the consent of all readers&mdash;that they shall all acknowledge
the spirit of that French.&nbsp; But perhaps it is a mere personal preference
that makes <i>le</i> <i>jour</i> <i>s&rsquo;annonce</i> also sacred.</p>
<p>If the hymn, &ldquo;Stabat Mater dolorosa,&rdquo; was written in
Latin, this could be only that it might in time find its true language
and incomparable phrase at last&mdash;that it might await the day of
life in its proper German.&nbsp; I found it there (and knew at once
the authentic verse, and knew at once for what tongue it had been really
destined) in the pages of the prayer-book of an apple-woman at an Innsbruck
church, and in the accents of her voice.</p>
<h2>A POINT OF BIOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>There is hardly a writer now&mdash;of the third class probably not
one&mdash;who has not something sharp and sad to say about the cruelty
of Nature; not one who is able to attempt May in the woods without a
modern reference to the manifold death and destruction with which the
air, the branches, the mosses are said to be full.</p>
<p>But no one has paused in the course of these phrases to take notice
of the curious and conspicuous fact of the suppression of death and
of the dead throughout this landscape of manifest life.&nbsp; Where
are they&mdash;all the dying, all the dead, of the populous woods?&nbsp;
Where do they hide their little last hours, where are they buried?&nbsp;
Where is the violence concealed?&nbsp; Under what gay custom and decent
habit?&nbsp; You may see, it is true, an earth-worm in a robin&rsquo;s
beak, and may hear a thrush breaking a snail&rsquo;s shell; but these
little things are, as it were, passed by with a kind of twinkle for
apology, as by a well-bred man who does openly some little solecism
which is too slight for direct mention, and which a meaner man might
hide or avoid.&nbsp; Unless you are very modern indeed, you twinkle
back at the bird.</p>
<p>But otherwise there is nothing visible of the havoc and the prey
and plunder.&nbsp; It is certain that much of the visible life passes
violently into other forms, flashes without pause into another flame;
but not all.&nbsp; Amid all the killing there must be much dying.&nbsp;
There are, for instance, few birds of prey left in our more accessible
counties now, and many thousands of birds must die uncaught by a hawk
and unpierced.&nbsp; But if their killing is done so modestly, so then
is their dying also.&nbsp; Short lives have all these wild things, but
there are innumerable flocks of them always alive; they must die, then,
in innumerable flocks.&nbsp; And yet they keep the millions of the dead
out of sight.</p>
<p>Now and then, indeed, they may be betrayed.&nbsp; It happened in
a cold winter.&nbsp; The late frosts were so sudden, and the famine
was so complete, that the birds were taken unawares.&nbsp; The sky and
the earth conspired that February to make known all the secrets; everything
was published.&nbsp; Death was manifest.&nbsp; Editors, when a great
man dies, are not more resolute than was the frost of &rsquo;95.</p>
<p>The birds were obliged to die in public.&nbsp; They were surprised
and forced to do thus.&nbsp; They became like Shelley in the monument
which the art and imagination of England combined to raise to his memory
at Oxford.</p>
<p>Frost was surely at work in both cases, and in both it wrought wrong.&nbsp;
There is a similarity of unreason in betraying the death of a bird and
in exhibiting the death of Shelley.&nbsp; The death of a soldier&mdash;<i>passe</i>
<i>encore</i>.&nbsp; But the death of Shelley was not his goal.&nbsp;
And the death of the birds is so little characteristic of them that,
as has just been said, no one in the world is aware of their dying,
except only in the case of birds in cages, who, again, are compelled
to die with observation.&nbsp; The woodland is guarded and kept by a
rule.&nbsp; There is no display of the battlefield in the fields.&nbsp;
There is no tale of the game-bag, no boast.&nbsp; The hunting goes on,
but with strange decorum.&nbsp; You may pass a fine season under the
trees, and see nothing dead except here and there where a boy has been
by, or a man with a trap, or a man with a gun.&nbsp; There is nothing
like a butcher&rsquo;s shop in the woods.</p>
<p>But the biographers have always had other ways than those of the
wild world.&nbsp; They will not have a man to die out of sight.&nbsp;
I have turned over scores of &ldquo;Lives,&rdquo; not to read them,
but to see whether now and again there might be a &ldquo;Life&rdquo;
which was not more emphatically a death.&nbsp; But there never is a
modern biography that has taken the hint of Nature.&nbsp; One and all,
these books have the disproportionate illness, the death out of all
scale.</p>
<p>Even more wanton than the disclosure of a death is that of a mortal
illness.&nbsp; If the man had recovered, his illness would have been
rightly his own secret.&nbsp; But because he did not recover, it is
assumed to be news for the first comer.&nbsp; Which of us would suffer
the details of any physical suffering, over and done in our own lives,
to be displayed and described?&nbsp; This is not a confidence we have
a mind to make; and no one is authorised to ask for attention or pity
on our behalf.&nbsp; The story of pain ought not to be told of us, seeing
that by us it would assuredly not be told.</p>
<p>There is only one other thing that concerns a man still more exclusively,
and that is his own mental illness, or the dreams and illusions of a
long delirium.&nbsp; When he is in common language not himself, amends
should be made for so bitter a paradox; he should be allowed such solitude
as is possible to the alienated spirit; he should be left to the &ldquo;not
himself,&rdquo; and spared the intrusion against which he can so ill
guard that he could hardly have even resented it.</p>
<p>The double helplessness of delusion and death should keep the door
of Rossetti&rsquo;s house, for example, and refuse him to the reader.&nbsp;
His mortal illness had nothing to do with his poetry.&nbsp; Some rather
affected objection is taken every now and then to the publication of
some facts (others being already well known) in the life of Shelley.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, these are all, properly speaking, biography.&nbsp; What
is not biography is the detail of the accident of the manner of his
death, the detail of his cremation.&nbsp; Or if it was to be told&mdash;told
briefly&mdash;it was certainly not for marble.&nbsp; Shelley&rsquo;s
death had no significance, except inasmuch as he died young.&nbsp; It
was a detachable and disconnected incident.&nbsp; Ah, that was a frost
of fancy and of the heart that used it so, dealing with an insignificant
fact, and conferring a futile immortality.&nbsp; Those are ill-named
biographers who seem to think that a betrayal of the ways of death is
a part of their ordinary duty, and that if material enough for a last
chapter does not lie to their hand they are to search it out.&nbsp;
They, of all survivors, are called upon, in honour and reason, to look
upon a death with more composure.&nbsp; To those who loved the dead
closely, this is, for a time, impossible.&nbsp; To them death becomes,
for a year, disproportionate.&nbsp; Their dreams are fixed upon it night
by night.&nbsp; They have, in those dreams, to find the dead in some
labyrinth; they have to mourn his dying and to welcome his recovery
in such a mingling of distress and of always incredulous happiness as
is not known even to dreams save in that first year of separation.&nbsp;
But they are not biographers.</p>
<p>If death is the privacy of the woods, it is the more conspicuously
secret because it is their only privacy.&nbsp; You may watch or may
surprise everything else.&nbsp; The nest is retired, not hidden.&nbsp;
The chase goes on everywhere.&nbsp; It is wonderful how the perpetual
chase seems to cause no perpetual fear.&nbsp; The songs are all audible.&nbsp;
Life is undefended, careless, nimble and noisy.</p>
<p>It is a happy thing that minor artists have ceased, or almost ceased,
to paint dead birds.&nbsp; Time was when they did it continually in
that British School of water-colour art, stippled, of which surrounding
nations, it was agreed, were envious.&nbsp; They must have killed their
bird to paint him, for he is not to be caught dead.&nbsp; A bird is
more easily caught alive than dead.</p>
<p>A poet, on the contrary, is easily&mdash;too easily&mdash;caught
dead.&nbsp; Minor artists now seldom stipple the bird on its back, but
a good sculptor and a University together modelled their Shelley on
his back, unessentially drowned; and everybody may read about the sick
mind of Dante Rossetti.</p>
<h2>THE HONOURS OF MORTALITY</h2>
<p>The brilliant talent which has quite lately and quite suddenly arisen,
to devote itself to the use of the day or of the week, in illustrated
papers&mdash;the enormous production of art in black and white&mdash;is
assuredly a confession that the Honours of Mortality are worth working
for.&nbsp; Fifty years ago, men worked for the honours of immortality;
these were the commonplace of their ambition; they declined to attend
to the beauty of things of use that were destined to be broken and worn
out, and they looked forward to surviving themselves by painting bad
pictures; so that what to do with their bad pictures in addition to
our own has become the problem of the nation and of the householder
alike.&nbsp; To-day men have began to learn that their sons will be
grateful to them for few bequests.&nbsp; Art consents at last to work
upon the tissue and the china that are doomed to the natural and necessary
end&mdash;destruction; and art shows a most dignified alacrity to do
her best, daily, for the &ldquo;process,&rdquo; and for oblivion.</p>
<p>Doubtless this abandonment of hopes so large at once and so cheap
costs the artist something; nay, it implies an acceptance of the inevitable
that is not less than heroic.&nbsp; And the reward has been in the singular
and manifest increase of vitality in this work which is done for so
short a life.&nbsp; Fittingly indeed does life reward the acceptance
of death, inasmuch as to die is to have been alive.&nbsp; There is a
real circulation of blood-quick use, brief beauty, abolition, recreation.&nbsp;
The honour of the day is for ever the honour of that day.&nbsp; It goes
into the treasury of things that are honestly and&mdash;completely ended
and done with.&nbsp; And when can so happy a thing be said of a lifeless
oil-painting?&nbsp; Who of the wise would hesitate?&nbsp; To be honourable
for one day&mdash;one named and dated day, separate from all other days
of the ages&mdash;or to be for an unlimited time tedious?</p>
<h2>COMPOSURE</h2>
<p>Tribulation, Immortality, the Multitude: what remedy of composure
do these words bring for their own great disquiet!&nbsp; Without the
remoteness of the Latinity the thought would come too close and shake
too cruelly.&nbsp; In order to the sane endurance of the intimate trouble
of the soul an aloofness of language is needful.&nbsp; Johnson feared
death.&nbsp; Did his noble English control and postpone the terror?&nbsp;
Did it keep the fear at some courteous, deferent distance from the centre
of that human heart, in the very act of the leap and lapse of mortality?&nbsp;
Doubtless there is in language such an educative power.&nbsp; Speech
is a school.&nbsp; Every language is a persuasion, an induced habit,
an instrument which receives the note indeed but gives the tone.&nbsp;
Every language imposes a quality, teaches a temper, proposes a way,
bestows a tradition: this is the tone&mdash;the voice&mdash;of the instrument.&nbsp;
Every language, by counterchange, returns to the writer&rsquo;s touch
or breath his own intention, articulate: this is his note.&nbsp; Much
has always been said, many things to the purpose have been thought,
of the power and the responsibility of the note.&nbsp; Of the legislation
and influence of the tone I have been led to think by comparing the
tranquillity of Johnson and the composure of Canning with the stimulated
and close emotion, the interior trouble, of those writers who have entered
as disciples in the school of the more Teutonic English.</p>
<p>For if every language be a school, more significantly and more educatively
is a part of a language a school to him who chooses that part.&nbsp;
Few languages offer the choice.&nbsp; The fact that a choice is made
implies the results and fruits of a decision.&nbsp; The French author
is without these.&nbsp; They are of all the heritages of the English
writer the most important.&nbsp; He receives a language of dual derivation.&nbsp;
He may submit himself to either University, whither he will take his
impulse and his character, where he will leave their influence, and
whence he will accept their re-education.&nbsp; The Frenchman has certainly
a style to develop within definite limits; but he does not subject himself
to suggestions tending mainly hitherwards or thitherwards, to currents
of various race within one literature.&nbsp; Such a choice of subjection
is the singular opportunity of the Englishman.&nbsp; I do not mean to
ignore the necessary mingling.&nbsp; Happily that mingling has been
done once for all for us all.&nbsp; Nay, one of the most charming things
that a master of English can achieve is the repayment of the united
teaching by linking their results so exquisitely in his own practice,
that words of the two schools are made to meet each other with a surprise
and delight that shall prove them at once gayer strangers, and sweeter
companions, than the world knew they were.&nbsp; Nevertheless there
remains the liberty of choice as to which school of words shall have
the place of honour in the great and sensitive moments of an author&rsquo;s
style: which school shall be used for conspicuousness, and which for
multitudinous service.&nbsp; And the choice being open, the perturbation
of the pulses and impulses of so many hearts quickened in thought and
feeling in this day suggests to me a deliberate return to the recollectedness
of the more tranquil language.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doubtless there is a place
of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A place of peace, not of indifference.&nbsp; It is impossible not
to charge some of the moralists of the eighteenth century with an indifference
into which they educated their platitudes and into which their platitudes
educated them.&nbsp; Addison thus gave and took, until he was almost
incapable of coming within arm&rsquo;s-length of a real or spiritual
emotion.&nbsp; There is no knowing to what distance the removal of the
&ldquo;appropriate sentiment&rdquo; from the central soul might have
attained but for the change and renewal in language, which came when
it was needed.&nbsp; Addison had assuredly removed eternity far from
the apprehension of the soul when his Cato hailed the &ldquo;pleasing
hope,&rdquo; the &ldquo;fond desire&rdquo;; and the touch of war was
distant from him who conceived his &ldquo;repulsed battalions&rdquo;
and his &ldquo;doubtful battle.&rdquo;&nbsp; What came afterwards, when
simplicity and nearness were restored once more, was doubtless journeyman&rsquo;s
work at times.&nbsp; Men were too eager to go into the workshop of language.&nbsp;
There were unreasonable raptures over the mere making of common words.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A hand-shoe! a finger-hat! a foreword!&nbsp; Beautiful!&rdquo;
they cried; and for the love of German the youngest daughter of Chrysale
herself might have consented to be kissed by a grammarian.&nbsp; It
seemed to be forgotten that a language with all its construction visible
is a language little fitted for the more advanced mental processes;
that its images are material; and that, on the other hand, a certain
spiritualizing and subtilizing effect of alien derivations is a privilege
and an advantage incalculable&mdash;that to possess that half of the
language within which Latin heredities lurk and Romanesque allusions
are at play is to possess the state and security of a dead tongue, without
the death.</p>
<p>But now I spoke of words encountering as gay strangers, various in
origin, divided in race, within a master&rsquo;s phrase.&nbsp; The most
beautiful and the most sudden of such meetings are of course in Shakespeare.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Superfluous kings,&rdquo; &ldquo;A lass unparalleled,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Multitudinous seas&rdquo;: we needed not to wait for the eighteenth
century or for the nineteenth or for the twentieth to learn the splendour
of such encounters, of such differences, of such nuptial unlikeness
and union.&nbsp; But it is well that we should learn them afresh.&nbsp;
And it is well, too, that we should not resist the rhythmic reaction
bearing us now somewhat to the side of the Latin.&nbsp; Such a reaction
is in some sort an ethical need for our day.&nbsp; We want to quell
the exaggerated decision of monosyllables.&nbsp; We want the poise and
the pause that imply vitality at times better than headstrong movement
expresses it.&nbsp; And not the phrase only but the form of verse might
render us timely service.&nbsp; The controlling couplet might stay with
a touch a modern grief, as it ranged in order the sorrows of Canning
for his son.&nbsp; But it should not be attempted without a distinct
intention of submission on the part of the writer.&nbsp; The couplet
transgressed against, trespassed upon, used loosely, is like a law outstripped,
defied&mdash;to the dignity neither of the rebel nor of the rule.</p>
<p>To Letters do we look now for the guidance and direction which the
very closeness of the emotion taking us by the heart makes necessary.&nbsp;
Shall not the Thing more and more, as we compose ourselves to literature,
assume the honour, the hesitation, the leisure, the reconciliation of
the Word?</p>
<h2>THE LITTLE LANGUAGE</h2>
<p>Dialect is the elf rather than the genius of place, and a dwarfish
master of the magic of local things.</p>
<p>In England we hardly know what a concentrated homeliness it nourishes;
inasmuch as, with us, the castes and classes for whom Goldoni and Gallina
and Signor Fogazzaro have written in the patois of the Veneto, use no
dialect at all.</p>
<p>Neither Goldoni nor Gallina has charged the Venetian language with
so much literature as to take from the people the shelter of their almost
unwritten tongue.&nbsp; Signor Fogazzaro, bringing tragedy into the
homes of dialect, does but show us how the language staggers under such
a stress, how it breaks down, and resigns that office.&nbsp; One of
the finest of the characters in the ranks of his admirable fiction is
that old manageress of the narrow things of the house whose daughter
is dying insane.&nbsp; I have called the dialect a shelter.&nbsp; This
it is; but the poor lady does not cower within; her resigned head erect,
she is shut out from that homely refuge, suffering and inarticulate.&nbsp;
The two dramatists in their several centuries also recognized the inability
of the dialect.&nbsp; They laid none but light loads upon it.&nbsp;
They caused it to carry no more in their homely plays than it carries
in homely life.&nbsp; Their work leaves it what it was&mdash;the talk
of a people talking much about few things; a people like our own and
any other in their lack of literature, but local and all Italian in
their lack of silence.</p>
<p>Common speech is surely a greater part of life to such a people than
to one less pleased with chatter or more pleased with books.&nbsp; I
am writing of men, women, and children (and children are not forgotten,
since we share a patois with children on terms of more than common equality)
who possess, for all occasions of ceremony and opportunities of dignity,
a general, national, liberal, able, and illustrious tongue, charged
with all its history and all its achievements; for the speakers of dialect,
of a certain rank, speak Italian, too.&nbsp; But to tamper with their
dialect, or to take it from them, would be to leave them houseless and
exposed in their daily business.&nbsp; So much does their patois seem
to be their refuge from the heavy and multitudinous experiences of a
literary tongue, that the stopping of a fox&rsquo;s earth might be taken
as the image of any act that should spoil or stop the talk of the associated
seclusion of their town, and leave them in the bleakness of a larger
patriotism.</p>
<p>The Venetian people, the Genoese, and the other speakers of languages
that might all have proved right &ldquo;Italian&rdquo; had not Dante,
Petrarch and Boccaccio written in Tuscan, can neither write nor be taught
hard things in their dialect, although they can live, whether easy lives
or hard, and evidently can die, therein.&nbsp; The hands and feet that
have served the villager and the citizen at homely tasks have all the
lowliness of his patois, to his mind; and when he must perforce yield
up their employment, we may believe that it is a simple thing to die
in so simple and so narrow a language, one so comfortable, neighbourly,
tolerant, and compassionate; so confidential; so incapable, ignorant,
unappalling, inapt to wing any wearied thought upon difficult flight
or to spur it upon hard travelling.</p>
<p>Not without words is mental pain, or even physical pain, to be undergone;
but the words that have done no more than order the things of the narrow
street are not words to put a fine edge or a piercing point to any human
pang.&nbsp; It may even well be that to die in dialect is easier than
to die in the eloquence of Manfred, though that declaimed language,
too, is doubtless a defence, if one of a different manner.</p>
<p>These writers in Venetian&mdash;they are named because in no other
Italian dialect has work so popular as Goldoni&rsquo;s been done, nor
so excellent as Signor Fogazzaro&rsquo;s&mdash;have left the unlettered
local language in which they loved to deal, to its proper limitations.&nbsp;
They have not given weighty things into its charge, nor made it heavily
responsible.&nbsp; They have added nothing to it; nay, by writing it
they might even be said to have made it duller, had it not been for
the reader and the actor.&nbsp; Insomuch as the intense expressiveness
of a dialect&mdash;of a small vocabulary in the mouth of a dramatic
people&mdash;lies in the various accent wherewith a southern citizen
knows how to enrich his talk, it remains for the actor to restore its
life to the written phrase.&nbsp; In dialect the author is forbidden
to search for the word, for there is none lurking for his choice; but
of tones, allusions, and of references and inferences of the voice,
the speaker of dialect is a master.&nbsp; No range of phrases can be
his, but he has the more or the less confidential inflection, until
at times the close communication of the narrow street becomes a very
conspiracy.</p>
<p>Let it be borne in mind that dialect properly so called is something
all unlike, for instance, the mere jargon of London streets.&nbsp; The
difference may be measured by the fact that Italian dialects have a
highly organized and orderly grammar.&nbsp; The Londoner cannot keep
the small and loose order of the grammar of good English; the Genoese
conjugates his patois verbs, with subjunctives and all things of that
handsome kind, lacked by the English of Universities.</p>
<p>The middle class&mdash;the <i>piccolo</i> <i>mondo&mdash;</i>that
shares Italian dialect with the poor are more strictly local in their
manners than either the opulent or the indigent of the same city.&nbsp;
They have moreover the busy intelligence (which is the intellect of
patois) at its keenest.&nbsp; Their speech keeps them a sequestered
place which is Italian, Italian beyond the ken of the traveller, and
beyond the reach of alteration.&nbsp; And&mdash;what is pretty to observe&mdash;the
speakers are well conscious of the characters of this intimate language.&nbsp;
An Italian countryman who has known no other climate will vaunt, in
fervent platitudes, his Italian sun; in like manner he is conscious
of the local character of his language, and tucks himself within it
at home, whatever Tuscan he may speak abroad.&nbsp; A properly spelt
letter, Swift said, would seem to expose him and Mrs Dingley and Stella
to the eyes of the world; but their little language, ill-written, was
&ldquo;snug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lovers have made a little language in all times; finding the nobler
language insufficient, do they ensconce themselves in the smaller? discard
noble and literary speech as not noble enough, and in despair thus prattle
and gibber and stammer?&nbsp; Rather perhaps this departure from English
is but an excursion after gaiety.&nbsp; The ideal lovers, no doubt,
would be so simple as to be grave.&nbsp; That is a tenable opinion.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, age by age they have been gay; and age by age they have
exchanged language imitated from the children they doubtless never studied,
and perhaps never loved.&nbsp; Why so?&nbsp; They might have chosen
broken English of other sorts&mdash;that, for example, which was once
thought amusing in farce, as spoken by the Frenchman conceived by the
Englishman&mdash;a complication of humour fictitious enough, one might
think, to please anyone; or else a fragment of negro dialect; or the
style of telegrams; or the masterly adaptation of the simple savage&rsquo;s
English devised by Mrs Plornish in her intercourse with the Italian.&nbsp;
But none of these found favour.&nbsp; The choice has always been of
the language of children.&nbsp; Let us suppose that the flock of winged
Loves worshipping Venus in the Titian picture, and the noble child that
rides his lion erect with a background of Venetian gloomy dusk, may
be the inspirers of those prattlings.&nbsp; &ldquo;See then thy selfe
likewise art lyttle made,&rdquo; says Spenser&rsquo;s Venus to her child.</p>
<p>Swift was the best prattler.&nbsp; He had caught the language, surprised
it in Stella when she was veritably a child.&nbsp; He did not push her
clumsily back into a childhood he had not known; he simply prolonged
in her a childhood he had loved.&nbsp; He is &ldquo;seepy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nite, dealest dea, nite dealest logue.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a real
good-night.&nbsp; It breathes tenderness from that moody and uneasy
bed of projects.</p>
<h2>A COUNTERCHANGE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Il s&rsquo;est tromp&eacute; de d&eacute;funte.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The writer of this phrase had his sense of that portly manner of French,
and his burlesque is fine; but&mdash;the paradox must be risked&mdash;because
he was French he was not able to possess all its grotesque mediocrity
to the full; that is reserved for the English reader.&nbsp; The words
are in the mouth of a widower who, approaching his wife&rsquo;s tomb,
perceives there another &ldquo;monsieur.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo;
again; the French reader is deprived of the value of this word, too,
in its place; it says little or nothing to him, whereas the Englishman,
who has no word of the precise bourgeois significance that it sometimes
bears, but who must use one of two English words of different allusion&mdash;man
or I gentleman&mdash;knows the exact value of its commonplace.&nbsp;
The serious Parisian, then, sees &ldquo;un autre monsieur;&rdquo; as
it proves anon, there had been a divorce in the history of the lady,
but the later widower is not yet aware of this, and explains to himself
the presence of &ldquo;un monsieur&rdquo; in his own place by that weighty
phrase, &ldquo;Il s&rsquo;est tromp&eacute; de d&eacute;funte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strange effect of a thing so charged with allusion and with national
character is to cause an English reader to pity the mocking author who
was debarred by his own language from possessing the whole of his own
comedy.&nbsp; It is, in fact, by contrast with his English that an Englishman
does possess it.&nbsp; Your official, your professional Parisian has
a vocabulary of enormous, unrivalled mediocrity.&nbsp; When the novelist
perceives this he does not perceive it all, because some of the words
are the only words in use.&nbsp; Take an author at his serious moments,
when he is not at all occupied with the comedy of phrases, and he now
and then touches a word that has its burlesque by mere contrast with
English.&nbsp; &ldquo;L&rsquo;Histoire d&rsquo;un Crime,&rdquo; of Victor
Hugo, has so many of these touches as to be, by a kind of reflex action,
a very school of English.&nbsp; The whole incident of the omnibus in
that grave work has unconscious international comedy.&nbsp; The Deputies
seated in the interior of the omnibus had been, it will be remembered,
shut out of their Chamber by the perpetrator of the Coup d&rsquo;Etat,
but each had his official scarf.&nbsp; Scarf&mdash;pish!&mdash;&ldquo;l&rsquo;&eacute;charpe!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ceindre l&rsquo;&eacute;charpe&rdquo;&mdash;there is no real
English equivalent.&nbsp; Civic responsibility never was otherwise adequately
expressed.&nbsp; An indignant deputy passed his scarf through the window
of the omnibus, as an appeal to the public, &ldquo;et l&rsquo;agita.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is a pity that the French reader, having no simpler word, is not
in a position to understand the slight burlesque.&nbsp; Nay, the mere
word &ldquo;public,&rdquo; spoken with this peculiar French good faith,
has for us I know not what untransferable gravity.</p>
<p>There is, in short, a general international counterchange.&nbsp;
It is altogether in accordance with our actual state of civilization,
with its extremely &ldquo;specialized&rdquo; manner of industry, that
one people should make a phrase, and another should have and enjoy it.&nbsp;
And, in fact, there are certain French authors to whom should be secured
the use of the literary German whereof Germans, and German women in
particular, ought with all severity to be deprived.&nbsp; For Germans
often tell you of words in their own tongue that are untranslatable;
and accordingly they should not be translated, but given over in their
own conditions, unaltered, into safer hands.&nbsp; There would be a
clearing of the outlines of German ideas, a better order in the phrase;
the possessors of an alien word, with the thought it secures, would
find also their advantage.</p>
<p>So with French humour.&nbsp; It is expressly and signally for English
ears.&nbsp; It is so even in the commonest farce.&nbsp; The unfortunate
householder, for example, who is persuaded to keep walking in the conservatory
&ldquo;pour r&eacute;tablir la circulation,&rdquo; and the other who
describes himself &ldquo;sous-chef de bureau dans l&rsquo;enregistrement,&rdquo;
and he who proposes to &ldquo;faire hommage&rdquo; of a doubtful turbot
to the neighbouring &ldquo;employ&eacute; de l&rsquo;octroi&rdquo;&mdash;these
and all their like speak commonplaces so usual as to lose in their own
country the perfection of their dulness.&nbsp; We only, who have the
alternative of plainer and fresher words, understand it.&nbsp; It is
not the least of the advantages of our own dual English that we become
sensible of the mockery of certain phrases that in France have lost
half their ridicule, uncontrasted.</p>
<p>Take again the common rhetoric that has fixed itself in conversation
in all Latin languages&mdash;rhetoric that has ceased to have allusions,
either majestic or comic.&nbsp; To the ear somewhat unused to French
this proffers a frequent comedy that the well-accustomed ear, even of
an Englishman, no longer detects.&nbsp; A guard on a French railway,
who advised two travellers to take a certain train for fear they should
be obliged to &ldquo;v&eacute;g&eacute;ter&rdquo; for a whole hour in
the waiting-room of such or such a station seemed to the less practised
tourist to be a fresh kind of unexpected humourist.</p>
<p>One of the phrases always used in the business of charities and subscriptions
in France has more than the intentional comedy of the farce-writer;
one of the most absurd of his personages, wearying his visitors in the
country with a perpetual game of bowls, says to them: &ldquo;Nous jouons
cinquante centimes&mdash;les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices seront vers&eacute;s
int&eacute;gralement &agrave; la souscription qui est ouverte &agrave;
la commune pour la construction de notre maison d&rsquo;&eacute;cole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fl&eacute;trir,&rdquo; again.&nbsp; Nothing could be more
rhetorical than this perfectly common word of controversy.&nbsp; The
comic dramatist is well aware of the spent violence of this phrase,
with which every serious Frenchman will reply to opponents, especially
in public matters.&nbsp; But not even the comic dramatist is aware of
the last state of refuse commonplace that a word of this kind represents.&nbsp;
Refuse rhetoric, by the way, rather than Emerson&rsquo;s &ldquo;fossil
poetry,&rdquo; would seem to be the right name for human language as
some of the processes of the several recent centuries have left it.</p>
<p>The French comedy, then, is fairly stuffed with thin-S for an Englishman.&nbsp;
They are not all, it is true, so finely comic as &ldquo;Il s&rsquo;est
tromp&eacute; de d&eacute;funte.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the report of that
dull, incomparable sentence there is enough humour, and subtle enough,
for both the maker and the reader; for the author who perceives the
comedy as well as custom will permit, and for the reader who takes it
with the freshness of a stranger.&nbsp; But if not so keen as this,
the current word of French comedy is of the same quality of language.&nbsp;
When of the fourteen couples to be married by the mayor, for instance,
the deaf clerk has shuffled two, a looker-on pronounces: &ldquo;Il s&rsquo;est
emp&ecirc;tr&eacute; dans les futurs.&rdquo;&nbsp; But for a reader
who has a full sense of the several languages that exist in English
at the service of the several ways of human life, there is, from the
mere terminology of official France, high or low&mdash;daily France&mdash;a
gratuitous and uncovenanted smile to be had.&nbsp; With this the wit
of the report of French literature has not little to do.&nbsp; Nor is
it in itself, perhaps, reasonably comic, but the slightest irony of
circumstance makes it so.&nbsp; A very little of the mockery of conditions
brings out all the latent absurdity of the &ldquo;sixi&egrave;me et
septi&egrave;me arron-dissements,&rdquo; in the twinkling of an eye.&nbsp;
So is it with the mere &ldquo;domicile;&rdquo; with the aid of but a
little of the burlesque of life, the suit at law to &ldquo;r&eacute;int&eacute;grer
le domicile conjugal&rdquo; becomes as grotesque as a phrase can make
it.&nbsp; Even &ldquo;&agrave; domicile&rdquo; merely&mdash;the word
of every shopman&mdash;is, in the unconscious mouths of the speakers,
always awaiting the lightest touch of farce, if only an Englishman hears
it; so is the advice of the police that you shall &ldquo;circuler&rdquo;
in the street; so is the request, posted up, that you shall not, in
the churches.</p>
<p>So are the serious and ordinary phrases, &ldquo;maison nuptiale,&rdquo;
&ldquo;maison mortuaire,&rdquo; and the still more serious &ldquo;repos
dominical,&rdquo; &ldquo;oraison dominicale.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no
majesty in such words.&nbsp; The unsuspicious gravity with which they
are spoken broadcast is not to be wondered at, the language offering
no relief of contrast; and what is much to the credit of the comic sensibility
of literature is the fact that, through this general unconsciousness,
the ridicule of a thousand authors of comedy perceives the fun, and
singles out the familiar thing, and compels that most elaborate dulness
to amuse us.&nbsp; <i>Us</i>, above all, by virtue of the custom of
counterchange here set forth.</p>
<p>Who shall say whether, by operation of the same exchange, the English
poets that so persist in France may not reveal something within the
English language&mdash;one would be somewhat loth to think so&mdash;reserved
to the French reader peculiarly?&nbsp; Byron to the multitude, Edgar
Poe to the select?&nbsp; Then would some of the mysteries of French
reading of English be explained otherwise than by the plainer explanation
that has hitherto satisfied our haughty curiosity.&nbsp; The taste for
rhetoric seemed to account for Byron, and the desire of the rhetorician
to claim a taste for poetry seemed to account for Poe.&nbsp; But, after
all, <i>patatras</i>!&nbsp; Who can say?</p>
<h2>HARLEQUIN MERCUTIO</h2>
<p>The first time that Mercutio fell upon the English stage, there fell
with him a gay and hardly human figure; it fell, perhaps finally, for
English drama.&nbsp; That manner of man&mdash;Arlecchino, or Harlequin&mdash;had
outlived his playmates, Pantaleone, Brighella, Colombina, and the Clown.&nbsp;
A little of Pantaleone survives in old Capulet, a little in the father
of the Shrew, but the life of Mercutio in the one play, and of the subordinate
Tranio in the other, is less quickly spent, less easily put out, than
the smouldering of the old man.&nbsp; Arlecchino frolics in and out
of the tragedy and comedy of Shakespeare, until he thus dies in his
lightest, his brightest, his most vital shape.</p>
<p>Arlecchino, the tricksy and shifty spirit, the contriver, the busybody,
the trusty rogue, the wonder-worker, the man in disguise, the mercurial
one, lives on buoyantly in France to the age of Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp;
He is officious and efficacious in the skin of Mascarille and Ergaste
and Scapin; but he tends to be a lacquey, with a reference rather to
Antiquity and the Latin comedy than to the Middle Ages, as on the English
stage his mere memory survives differently to a later age in the person
of &ldquo;Charles, his friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; What convinces me that he
virtually died with Mercutio is chiefly this&mdash;that this comrade
of Romeo&rsquo;s lives so keenly as to be fully capable of the death
that he takes at Tybalt&rsquo;s sword-point; he lived indeed, he dies
indeed.&nbsp; Another thing that marks the close of a career of ages
is his loss of his long customary good luck.&nbsp; Who ever heard of
Arlecchino unfortunate before, at fault with his sword-play, overtaken
by tragedy?&nbsp; His time had surely come.&nbsp; The gay companion
was to bleed; Tybalt&rsquo;s sword had made a way.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door, but it served.</p>
<p>Some confusion comes to pass among the typical figures of the primitive
Italian play, because Harlequin, on that conventional little stage of
the past, has a hero&rsquo;s place, whereas when he interferes in human
affairs he is only the auxiliary.&nbsp; He might be lover and bridegroom
on the primitive stage, in the comedy of these few and unaltered types;
but when Pantaloon, Clown, and Harlequin play with really human beings,
then Harlequin can be no more than a friend of the hero, the friend
of the bridegroom.&nbsp; The five figures of the old stage dance attendance;
they play around the business of those who have the dignity of mortality;
they, poor immortals&mdash;a clown who does not die, a pantaloon never
far from death, who yet does not die, a Columbine who never attains
Desdemona&rsquo;s death of innocence or Juliet&rsquo;s death of rectitude
and passion&mdash;flit in the backward places of the stage.</p>
<p>Ariel fulfils his office, and is not of one kind with those he serves.&nbsp;
Is there a memory of Harlequin in that delicate figure?&nbsp; Something
of the subservient immortality, of the light indignity, proper to Pantaleone,
Brighella, Arlecchino, Colombina, and the Clown, hovers away from the
stage when Ariel is released from the trouble of human things.</p>
<p>Immortality, did I say?&nbsp; It was immortality until Mercutio fell.&nbsp;
And if some claim be made to it still because Harlequin has transformed
so many scenes for the pleasure of so many thousand children, since
Mercutio died, I must reply that our modern Harlequin is no more than
a <i>marionnette</i>; he has returned whence he came.&nbsp; A man may
play him, but he is&mdash;as he was first of all&mdash;a doll.&nbsp;
From doll-hood Arlecchino took life, and, so promoted, flitted through
a thousand comedies, only to be again what he first was; save that,
as once a doll played the man, so now a man plays the doll.&nbsp; It
is but a memory of Arlecchino that our children see, a poor statue or
image endowed with mobility rather than with life.</p>
<p>With Mercutio, vanished the light heart that had given to the serious
ages of the world an hour&rsquo;s refuge from the unforgotten burden
of responsible conscience; the light heart assumed, borrowed, made dramatically
the spectator&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; We are not serious now, and no heart
now is quite light, even for an hour.</p>
<h2>LAUGHTER</h2>
<p>Times have been, it is said, merrier than these; but it is certain
nevertheless that laughter never was so honoured as now; were it not
for the paradox one might say, it never was so grave.&nbsp; Everywhere
the joke &ldquo;emerges&rdquo;&mdash;as an &ldquo;elegant&rdquo; writer
might have it&mdash;emerges to catch the attention of the sense of humour;
and everywhere the sense of humour wanders, watches, and waits to honour
the appeal.</p>
<p>It loiters, vaguely but perpetually willing.&nbsp; It wears (let
the violent personification be pardoned) a hanging lip, and a wrinkle
in abeyance, and an eye in suspense.&nbsp; It is much at the service
of the vagrant encounterer, and may be accosted by any chance daughters
of the game.&nbsp; It stands in untoward places, or places that were
once inappropriate, and is early at some indefinite appointment, some
ubiquitous tryst, with the compliant jest.</p>
<p>All literature becomes a field of easy assignations; there is a constant
signalling, an endless recognition.&nbsp; Forms of approach are remitted.&nbsp;
And the joke and the sense of humour, with no surprise of meeting, or
no gaiety of strangeness, so customary has the promiscuity become, go
up and down the pages of the paper and the book.&nbsp; See, again, the
theatre.&nbsp; A somewhat easy sort of comic acting is by so much the
best thing upon our present stage that little else can claim&mdash;paradox
again apart&mdash;to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>There is, in a word, a determination, an increasing tendency away
from the Oriental estimate of laughter as a thing fitter for women,
fittest for children, and unfitted for the beard.&nbsp; Laughter is
everywhere and at every moment proclaimed to be the honourable occupation
of men, and in some degree distinctive of men, and no mean part of their
prerogative and privilege.&nbsp; The sense of humour is chiefly theirs,
and those who are not men are to be admitted to the jest upon their
explanation.&nbsp; They will not refuse explanation.&nbsp; And there
is little upon which a man will so value himself as upon that sense,
&ldquo;in England, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it would be a pity if laughter should ever become, like
rhetoric and the arts, a habit.&nbsp; And it is in some sort a habit
when it is not inevitable.&nbsp; If we ask ourselves why we laugh, we
must confess that we laugh oftenest because&mdash;being amused&mdash;we
intend to show that we are amused.&nbsp; We are right to make the sign,
but a smile would be as sure a signal as a laugh, and more sincere;
it would but be changing the convention; and the change would restore
laughter itself to its own place.&nbsp; We have fallen into the way
of using it to prove something&mdash;our sense of the goodness of the
jest, to wit; but laughter should not thus be used, it should go free.&nbsp;
It is not a demonstration, whether in logic, or&mdash;as the word demonstration
is now generally used&mdash;in emotion; and we do ill to charge it with
that office.</p>
<p>Something of the Oriental idea of dignity might not be amiss among
such a people as ourselves containing wide and numerous classes who
laugh without cause: audiences; crowds; a great many clergymen, who
perhaps first fell into the habit in the intention of proving that they
were not gloomy; but a vast number of laymen also who had not that excuse;
and many women who laugh in their uncertainty as to what is humorous
and what is not.&nbsp; This last is the most harmless of all kinds of
superfluous laughter.&nbsp; When it carries an apology, a confession
of natural and genial ignorance, and when a gentle creature laughs a
laugh of hazard and experiment, she is to be more than forgiven.&nbsp;
What she must not do is to laugh a laugh of instruction, and as it were
retrieve the jest that was never worth the taking.</p>
<p>There are, besides, a few women who do not disturb themselves as
to a sense of humour, but who laugh from a sense of happiness.&nbsp;
Childish is that trick, and sweet.&nbsp; For children, who always laugh
because they must, and never by way of proof or sign, laugh only half
their laughs out of their sense of humour; they laugh the rest under
a mere stimulation: because of abounding breath and blood; because some
one runs behind them, for example, and movement does so jog their spirits
that their legs fail them, for laughter, without a jest.</p>
<p>If ever the day should come when men and women shall be content to
signal their perception of humour by the natural smile, and shall keep
the laugh for its own unpremeditated act, shall laugh seldom, and simply,
and not thrice at the same thing&mdash;once for foolish surprise, and
twice for tardy intelligence, and thrice to let it be known that they
are amused&mdash;then it may be time to persuade this laughing nation
not to laugh so loud as it is wont in public.&nbsp; The theatre audiences
of louder-speaking nations laugh lower than ours.&nbsp; The laugh that
is chiefly a signal of the laugher&rsquo;s sense of the ridiculous is
necessarily loud; and it has the disadvantage of covering what we may
perhaps wish to hear from the actors.&nbsp; It is a public laugh, and
no ordinary citizen is called upon for a public laugh.&nbsp; He may
laugh in public, but let it be with private laughter there.</p>
<p>Let us, if anything like a general reform be possible in these times
of dispersion and of scattering, keep henceforth our sense of humour
in a place better guarded, as something worth a measure of seclusion.&nbsp;
It should not loiter in wait for the alms of a joke in adventurous places.&nbsp;
For the sense of humour has other things to do than to make itself conspicuous
in the act of laughter.&nbsp; It has negative tasks of valid virtue;
for example, the standing and waiting within call of tragedy itself,
where, excluded, it may keep guard.</p>
<p>No reasonable man will aver that the Oriental manners are best.&nbsp;
This would be to deny Shakespeare as his comrades knew him, where the
wit &ldquo;out-did the meat, out-did the frolic wine,&rdquo; and to
deny Ben Jonson&rsquo;s &ldquo;tart Aristophanes, neat Terence, witty
Plautus,&rdquo; and the rest.&nbsp; Doubtless Greece determined the
custom for all our Occident; but none the less might the modern world
grow more sensible of the value of composure.</p>
<p>To none other of the several powers of our souls do we so give rein
as to this of humour, and none other do we indulge with so little fastidiousness.&nbsp;
It is as though there were honour in governing the other senses, and
honour in refusing to govern this.&nbsp; It is as though we were ashamed
of reason here, and shy of dignity, and suspicious of temperance, and
diffident of moderation, and too eager to thrust forward that which
loses nothing by seclusion.</p>
<h2>THE RHYTHM OF LIFE</h2>
<p>If life is not always poetical, it is at least metrical.&nbsp; Periodicity
rules over the mental experience of man, according to the path of the
orbit of his thoughts.&nbsp; Distances are not gauged, ellipses not
measured, velocities not ascertained, times not known.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
the recurrence is sure.&nbsp; What the mind suffered last week, or last
year, it does not suffer now; but it will suffer again next week or
next year.&nbsp; Happiness is not a matter of events; it depends upon
the tides of the mind.&nbsp; Disease is metrical, closing in at shorter
and shorter periods towards death, sweeping abroad at longer and longer
intervals towards recovery.&nbsp; Sorrow for one cause was intolerable
yesterday, and will be intolerable to-morrow; to-day it is easy to bear,
but the cause has not passed.&nbsp; Even the burden of a spiritual distress
unsolved is bound to leave the heart to a temporary peace; and remorse
itself does not remain&mdash;it returns.&nbsp; Gaiety takes us by a
dear surprise.&nbsp; If we had made a course of notes of its visits,
we might have been on the watch, and would have had an expectation instead
of a discovery.&nbsp; No one makes such observations; in all the diaries
of students of the interior world, there have never come to light the
records of the Kepler of such cycles.&nbsp; But Thomas &agrave; Kempis
knew of the recurrences, if he did not measure them.&nbsp; In his cell
alone with the elements&mdash;&ldquo;What wouldst thou more than these?
for out of these were all things made&rdquo;&mdash;he learnt the stay
to be found in the depth of the hour of bitterness, and the remembrance
that restrains the soul at the coming of the moment of delight, giving
it a more conscious welcome, but presaging for it an inexorable flight.&nbsp;
And &ldquo;rarely, rarely comest thou,&rdquo; sighed Shelley, not to
Delight merely, but to the Spirit of Delight.&nbsp; Delight can be compelled
beforehand, called, and constrained to our service&mdash;Ariel can be
bound to a daily task; but such artificial violence throws life out
of metre, and it is not the spirit that is thus compelled.&nbsp; <i>That</i>
flits upon an orbit elliptically or parabolically or hyperbolically
curved, keeping no man knows what trysts with Time.</p>
<p>It seems fit that Shelley and the author of the &ldquo;Imitation&rdquo;
should both have been keen and simple enough to perceive these flights,
and to guess at the order of this periodicity.&nbsp; Both souls were
in close touch with the spirits of their several worlds, and no deliberate
human rules, no infractions of the liberty and law of the universal
movement, kept from them the knowledge of recurrences.&nbsp; <i>Eppur</i>
<i>si</i> <i>muove</i>.&nbsp; They knew that presence does not exist
without absence; they knew that what is just upon its flight of farewell
is already on its long path of return.&nbsp; They knew that what is
approaching to the very touch is hastening towards departure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O wind,&rdquo; cried Shelley, in autumn,</p>
<blockquote><p>O wind,<br />
If winter comes can spring be far behind?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They knew that the flux is equal to the reflux; that to interrupt
with unlawful recurrences, out of time, is to weaken the impulse of
onset and retreat; the sweep and impetus of movement.&nbsp; To live
in constant efforts after an equal life, whether the equality be sought
in mental production, or in spiritual sweetness, or in the joy of the
senses, is to live without either rest or full activity.&nbsp; The souls
of certain of the saints, being singularly simple and single, have been
in the most complete subjection to the law of periodicity.&nbsp; Ecstasy
and desolation visited them by seasons.&nbsp; They endured, during spaces
of vacant time, the interior loss of all for which they had sacrificed
the world.&nbsp; They rejoiced in the uncovenanted beatitude of sweetness
alighting in their hearts.&nbsp; Like them are the poets whom, three
times or ten times in the course of a long life, the Muse has approached,
touched, and forsaken.&nbsp; And yet hardly like them; not always so
docile, nor so wholly prepared for the departure, the brevity, of the
golden and irrevocable hour.&nbsp; Few poets have fully recognized the
metrical absence of their muse.&nbsp; For full recognition is expressed
in one only way&mdash;silence.</p>
<p>It has been found that several tribes in Africa and in America worship
the moon, and not the sun; a great number worship both; but no tribes
are known to adore the sun, and not the moon.&nbsp; On her depend the
tides; and she is Selene, mother of Herse, bringer of the dews that
recurrently irrigate lands where rain is rare.&nbsp; More than any other
companion of earth is she the Measurer.&nbsp; Early Indo-Germanic languages
knew her by that name.&nbsp; Her metrical phases are the symbol of the
order of recurrence.&nbsp; Constancy in approach and in departure is
the reason of her inconstancies.&nbsp; Juliet will not receive a vow
spoken in invocation of the moon; but Juliet did not live to know that
love itself has tidal times&mdash;lapses and ebbs which are due to the
metrical rule of the interior heart, but which the lover vainly and
unkindly attributes to some outward alteration in the beloved.&nbsp;
For man&mdash;except those elect already named&mdash;is hardly aware
of periodicity.&nbsp; The individual man either never learns it fully,
or learns it late.&nbsp; And he learns it so late, because it is a matter
of cumulative experience upon which cumulative evidence is long lacking.&nbsp;
It is in the after-part of each life that the law is learnt so definitely
as to do away with the hope or fear of continuance.&nbsp; That young
sorrow comes so near to despair is a result of this young ignorance.&nbsp;
So is the early hope of great achievement.&nbsp; Life seems so long,
and its capacity so great, to one who knows nothing of all the intervals
it needs must hold&mdash;intervals between aspirations, between actions,
pauses as inevitable as the pauses of sleep.&nbsp; And life looks impossible
to the young unfortunate, unaware of the inevitable and unfailing refreshment.&nbsp;
It would be for their peace to learn that there is a tide in the affairs
of men, in a sense more subtle&mdash;if it is not too audacious to add
a meaning to Shakespeare&mdash;than the phrase was meant to contain.&nbsp;
Their joy is flying away from them on its way home; their life will
wax and wane; and if they would be wise, they must wake and rest in
its phases, knowing that they are ruled by the law that commands all
things&mdash;a sun&rsquo;s revolutions and the rhythmic pangs of maternity.</p>
<h2>DOMUS ANGUSTA</h2>
<p>The narrow house is a small human nature compelled to a large human
destiny, charged with a fate too great, a history too various, for its
slight capacities.&nbsp; Men have commonly complained of fate; but their
complaints have been of the smallness, not of the greatness, of the
human lot.&nbsp; A disproportion&mdash;all in favour of man&mdash;between
man and his destiny is one of the things to be taken for granted in
literature: so frequent and so easy is the utterance of the habitual
lamentation as to the trouble of a &ldquo;vain capacity,&rdquo; so well
explained has it ever been.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thou hast not half the power to do me harm<br />
That I have to be hurt,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>discontented man seems to cry to Heaven, taking the words of the
brave Emilia.&nbsp; But inarticulate has been the voice within the narrow
house.&nbsp; Obviously it never had its poet.&nbsp; Little elocution
is there, little argument or definition, little explicitness.&nbsp;
And yet for every vain capacity we may assuredly count a thousand vain
destinies, for every liberal nature a thousand liberal fates.&nbsp;
It is the trouble of the wide house we hear of, clamorous of its disappointments
and desires.&nbsp; The narrow house has no echoes; yet its pathetic
shortcoming might well move pity.&nbsp; On that strait stage is acted
a generous tragedy; to that inadequate soul is intrusted an enormous
sorrow; a tempest of movement makes its home within that slender nature;
and heroic happiness seeks that timorous heart.</p>
<p>We may, indeed, in part know the narrow house by its inarticulateness&mdash;not,
certainly, its fewness of words, but its inadequacy and imprecision
of speech.&nbsp; For, doubtless, right language enlarges the soul as
no other power or influence may do.&nbsp; Who, for instance, but trusts
more nobly for knowing the full word of his confidence?&nbsp; Who but
loves more penetratingly for possessing the ultimate syllable of his
tenderness?&nbsp; There is a &ldquo;pledging of the word,&rdquo; in
another sense than the ordinary sense of troth and promise.&nbsp; The
poet pledges his word, his sentence, his verse, and finds therein a
peculiar sanction.&nbsp; And I suppose that even physical pain takes
on an edge when it not only enforces a pang but whispers a phrase.&nbsp;
Consciousness and the word are almost as closely united as thought and
the word.&nbsp; Almost&mdash;not quite; in spite of its inexpressive
speech, the narrow house is aware and sensitive beyond, as it were,
its poor power.</p>
<p>But as to the whole disparity between the destiny and the nature,
we know it to be general.&nbsp; Life is great that is trivially transmitted;
love is great that is vulgarly experienced.&nbsp; Death, too, is a heroic
virtue; and to the keeping of us all is death committed: death, submissive
in the indocile, modest in the fatuous, several in the vulgar, secret
in the familiar.&nbsp; It is destructive, because it not only closes
but contradicts life.&nbsp; Unlikely people die.&nbsp; The one certain
thing, it is also the one improbable.&nbsp; A dreadful paradox is perhaps
wrought upon a little nature that is incapable of death and yet is constrained
to die.&nbsp; That is a true destruction, and the thought of it is obscure.</p>
<p>Happy literature corrects all this disproportion by its immortal
pause.&nbsp; It does not bid us follow man or woman to an illogical
conclusion.&nbsp; Mrs. Micawber never does desert Mr. Micawber.&nbsp;
Considering her mental powers, by the way, an illogical conclusion for
her would be manifestly inappropriate.&nbsp; Shakespeare, indeed, having
seen a life whole, sees it to an end: sees it out, and Falstaff dies.&nbsp;
More than Promethean was the audacity that, having kindled, quenched
that spark.&nbsp; But otherwise the grotesque man in literature is immortal,
and with something more significant than the immortality awarded to
him in the sayings of rhetoric; he is perdurable because he is not completed.&nbsp;
His humours are strangely matched with perpetuity.&nbsp; But, indeed,
he is not worthy to die; for there is something graver than to be immortal,
and that is to be mortal.&nbsp; I protest I do not laugh at man or woman
in the world.&nbsp; I thank my fellow mortals for their wit, and also
for the kind of joke that the French so pleasantly call <i>une</i> <i>joyeuset&eacute;</i>;
these are to smile at.&nbsp; But the gay injustice of laughter is between
me and the man or woman in a book, in fiction, or on the stage in a
play.</p>
<p>That narrow house&mdash;there is sometimes a message from its living
windows.&nbsp; Its bewilderment, its reluctance, its defect, show by
moments from eyes that are apt to express none but common things.&nbsp;
There are allusions unawares, involuntary appeals, in those brief glances.&nbsp;
Far from me and from my friends be the misfortune of meeting such looks
in reply to pain of our inflicting.&nbsp; To be clever and sensitive
and to hurt the foolish and the stolid&mdash;&ldquo;wouldst thou do
such a deed for all the world?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>I shall not ask the commentators whether Blake used these two words
in union or in antithesis.&nbsp; They assuredly have an inseverable
union in the art of literature.&nbsp; The songs of Innocence and Experience
are for each poet the songs of his own separate heart and life; but
to take the cumulative experiences of other men, and to use these in
place of the virginal fruit of thought&mdash;whereas one would hardly
consent to take them for ordering even the most habitual of daily affairs&mdash;is
to forgo Innocence and Experience at once and together.&nbsp; Obviously,
Experience can be nothing except personal and separate; and Innocence
of a singularly solitary quality is his who does not dip his hands into
other men&rsquo;s histories, and does not give to his own word the common
sanction of other men&rsquo;s summaries and conclusions.&nbsp; Therefore
I bind Innocence and Experience in one, and take them as a sign of the
necessary and noble isolation of man from man&mdash;of his uniqueness.&nbsp;
But if I had a mind to forgo that manner of personal separateness, and
to use the things of others, I think I would rather appropriate their
future than their past.&nbsp; Let me put on their hopes, and the colours
of their confidence, if I must borrow.&nbsp; Not that I would burden
my prophetic soul with unjustified ambitions; but even this would be
more tolerable than to load my memory with an unjustifiable history.</p>
<p>And yet how differently do the writers of a certain kind of love-poetry
consider this matter.&nbsp; These are the love-poets who have no reluctance
in adopting the past of a multitude of people to whom they have not
even been introduced.&nbsp; Their verse is full of ready-made memories,
various, numerous, and cruel.&nbsp; No single life&mdash;supposing it
to be a liberal life concerned with something besides sex&mdash;could
quite suffice for so much experience, so much disillusion, so much <i>d&eacute;ception</i>.&nbsp;
To achieve that tone in its fullness it is necessary to take for one&rsquo;s
own the <i>praeterita</i> (say) of Alfred de Musset and of the men who
helped him&mdash;not to live but&mdash;to have lived; it is necessary
to have lived much more than any man lives, and to make a common hoard
of erotic remembrances with all kinds of poets.</p>
<p>As the Franciscans wear each other&rsquo;s old habits, and one friar
goes about darned because of another&rsquo;s rending, so the poet of
a certain order grows cynical for the sake of many poets&rsquo; old
loves.&nbsp; Not otherwise will the resultant verse succeed in implying
so much&mdash;or rather so many, in the feminine plural.&nbsp; The man
of very sensitive individuality might hesitate at the adoption.&nbsp;
The Franciscan is understood to have a fastidiousness and to overcome
it.&nbsp; And yet, if choice were, one might wish rather to make use
of one&rsquo;s fellow men&rsquo;s old shoes than put their old secrets
to use, and dress one&rsquo;s art in a motley of past passions.&nbsp;
Moreover, to utilize the mental experience of many is inevitably to
use their verse and phrase.&nbsp; For the rest, all the traits of this
love-poetry are familiar enough.&nbsp; One of them is the absence of
the word of promise and pledge, the loss of the earliest and simplest
of the impulses of love: which is the vow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Till death!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;For ever!&rdquo; are cries too simple and too natural to be commonplace,
and in their denial there is the least tolerable of banalities&mdash;that
of other men&rsquo;s disillusions.</p>
<p>Perfect personal distinctness of Experience would be in literature
a delicate Innocence.&nbsp; Not a passage of cheapness, of greed, of
assumption, of sloth, or of any such sins in the work of him whose love-poetry
were thus true, and whose <i>pudeur</i> of personality thus simple and
inviolate.&nbsp; This is the private man, in other words the gentleman,
who will neither love nor remember in common.</p>
<h2>THE HOURS OF SLEEP</h2>
<p>There are hours claimed by Sleep, but refused to him.&nbsp; None
the less are they his by some state within the mind, which answers rhythmically
and punctually to that claim.&nbsp; Awake and at work, without drowsiness,
without languor, and without gloom, the night mind of man is yet not
his day mind; he has night-powers of feeling which are at their highest
in dreams, but are night&rsquo;s as well as sleep&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
powers of the mind in dreams, which are inexplicable, are not altogether
baffled because the mind is awake; it is the hour of their return as
it is the hour of a tide&rsquo;s, and they do return.</p>
<p>In sleep they have their free way.&nbsp; Night then has nothing to
hamper her influence, and she draws the emotion, the senses, and the
nerves of the sleeper.&nbsp; She urges him upon those extremities of
anger and love, contempt and terror to which not only can no event of
the real day persuade him, but for which, awake, he has perhaps not
even the capacity.&nbsp; This increase of capacity, which is the dream&rsquo;s,
is punctual to the night, even though sleep and the dream be kept at
arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>The child, not asleep, but passing through the hours of sleep and
their dominions, knows that the mood of night will have its hour; he
puts off his troubled heart, and will answer it another time, in the
other state, by day.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall be able to bear this when
I am grown up&rdquo; is not oftener in a young child&rsquo;s mind than
&ldquo;I shall endure to think of it in the day-time.&rdquo;&nbsp; By
this he confesses the double habit and double experience, not to be
interchanged, and communicating together only by memory and hope.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be found that to work all by day or all by night
is to miss something of the powers of a complex mind.&nbsp; One might
imagine the rhythmic experience of a poet, subject, like a child, to
the time, and tempering the extremities of either state by messages
of remembrance and expectancy.</p>
<p>Never to have had a brilliant dream, and never to have had any delirium,
would be to live too much in the day; and hardly less would be the loss
of him who had not exercised his waking thought under the influence
of the hours claimed by dreams.&nbsp; And as to choosing between day
and night, or guessing whether the state of day or dark is the truer
and the more natural, he would be rash who should make too sure.</p>
<p>In order to live the life of night, a watcher must not wake too much.&nbsp;
That is, he should not alter so greatly the character of night as to
lose the solitude, the visible darkness, or the quietude.&nbsp; The
hours of sleep are too much altered when they are filled by lights and
crowds; and Nature is cheated so, and evaded, and her rhythm broken,
as when the larks caged in populous streets make ineffectual springs
and sing daybreak songs when the London gas is lighted.&nbsp; Nature
is easily deceived; and the muse, like the lark, may be set all astray
as to the hour.&nbsp; You may spend the peculiar hours of sleep amid
so much noise and among so many people that you shall not be aware of
them; you may thus merely force and prolong the day.&nbsp; But to do
so is not to live well both lives; it is not to yield to the daily and
nightly rise and fall and to be cradled in the swing of change.</p>
<p>There surely never was a poet but was now and then rocked in such
a cradle of alternate hours.&nbsp; &ldquo;It cannot be,&rdquo; says
Herbert, &ldquo;that I am he on whom Thy tempests fell all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is in the hours of sleep that the mind, by some divine paradox,
has the extremest sense of light.&nbsp; Almost the most shining lines
in English poetry&mdash;lines that cast sunrise shadows&mdash;are those
of Blake, written confessedly from the side of night, the side of sorrow
and dreams, and those dreams the dreams of little chimney-sweepers;
all is as dark as he can make it with the &ldquo;bags of soot&rdquo;;
but the boy&rsquo;s dream of the green plain and the river is too bright
for day.&nbsp; So, indeed, is another brightness of Blake&rsquo;s, which
is also, in his poem, a child&rsquo;s dream, and was certainly conceived
by him in the hours of sleep, in which he woke to write the Songs of
Innocence:-</p>
<blockquote><p>O what land is the land of dreams?<br />
What are its mountains, and what are its streams?<br />
O father, I saw my mother there,<br />
Among the lilies by waters fair.<br />
Among the lambs cloth&eacute;d in white,<br />
She walk&rsquo;d with her Thomas in sweet delight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To none but the hours claimed and inspired by sleep, held awake by
sufferance of sleep, belongs such a vision.</p>
<p>Corot also took the brilliant opportunity of the hours of sleep.&nbsp;
In some landscapes of his early manner he has the very light of dreams,
and it was surely because he went abroad at the time when sleep and
dreams claimed his eyes that he was able to see so spiritual an illumination.&nbsp;
Summer is precious for a painter, chiefly because in summer so many
of the hours of sleep are also hours of light.&nbsp; He carries the
mood of man&rsquo;s night out into the sunshine&mdash;Corot did so&mdash;and
lives the life of night, in all its genius, in the presence of a risen
sun.&nbsp; In the only time when the heart can dream of light, in the
night of visions, with the rhythmic power of night at its dark noon
in his mind, his eyes see the soaring of the actual sun.</p>
<p>He himself has not yet passed at that hour into the life of day.&nbsp;
To that life belongs many another kind of work, and a sense of other
kinds of beauty; but the summer daybreak was seen by Corot with the
extreme perception of the life of night.&nbsp; Here, at last, is the
explanation of all the memories of dreams recalled by these visionary
paintings, done in earlier years than were those, better known, that
are the Corots of all the world.&nbsp; Every man who knows what it is
to dream of landscape meets with one of these works of Corot&rsquo;s
first manner with a cry, not of welcome only, but of recognition.&nbsp;
Here is morning perceived by the spirit of the hours of sleep.</p>
<h2>SOLITUDE</h2>
<p>The wild man is alone at will, and so is the man for whom civilization
has been kind.&nbsp; But there are the multitudes to whom civilization
has given little but its reaction, its rebound, its chips, its refuse,
its shavings, sawdust and waste, its failures; to them solitude is a
right foregone or a luxury unattained; a right foregone, we may name
it, in the case of the nearly savage, and a luxury unattained in the
case of the nearly refined.&nbsp; These has the movement of the world
thronged together into some blind by-way.</p>
<p>Their share in the enormous solitude which is the common, unbounded,
and virtually illimitable possession of all mankind has lapsed, unclaimed.&nbsp;
They do not know it is theirs.&nbsp; Of many of their kingdoms they
are ignorant, but of this most ignorant.&nbsp; They have not guessed
that they own for every man a space inviolate, a place of unhidden liberty
and of no obscure enfranchisement.&nbsp; They do not claim even the
solitude of closed corners, the narrow privacy of the lock and key;
nor could they command so much.&nbsp; For the solitude that has a sky
and a horizon they know not how to wish.</p>
<p>It lies in a perpetual distance.&nbsp; England has leagues thereof,
landscapes, verge beyond verge, a thousand thousand places in the woods,
and on uplifted hills.&nbsp; Or rather, solitudes are not to be measured
by miles; they are to be numbered by days.&nbsp; They are freshly and
freely the dominion of every man for the day of his possession.&nbsp;
There is loneliness for innumerable solitaries.&nbsp; As many days as
there are in all the ages, so many solitudes are there for men.&nbsp;
This is the open house of the earth; no one is refused.&nbsp; Nor is
the space shortened or the silence marred because, one by one, men in
multitudes have been alone there before.&nbsp; Solitude is separate
experience.&nbsp; Nay, solitudes are not to be numbered by days, but
by men themselves.&nbsp; Every man of the living and every man of the
dead might have had his &ldquo;privacy of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It needs no park.&nbsp; It is to be found in the merest working country;
and a thicket may be as secret as a forest.&nbsp; It is not so difficult
to get for a time out of sight and earshot.&nbsp; Even if your solitude
be enclosed, it is still an open solitude, so there be &ldquo;no cloister
for the eyes,&rdquo; and a space of far country or a cloud in the sky
be privy to your hiding-place.&nbsp; But the best solitude does not
hide at all.</p>
<p>This the people who have drifted together into the streets live whole
lives and never know.&nbsp; Do they suffer from their deprivation of
even the solitude of the hiding-place?&nbsp; There are many who never
have a whole hour alone.&nbsp; They live in reluctant or indifferent
companionship, as people may in a boarding-house, by paradoxical choice,
familiar with one another and not intimate.&nbsp; They live under careless
observation and subject to a vagabond curiosity.&nbsp; Theirs is the
involuntary and perhaps the unconscious loss which is futile and barren.</p>
<p>One knows the men, and the many women, who have sacrificed all their
solitude to the perpetual society of the school, the cloister, or the
hospital ward.&nbsp; They walk without secrecy, candid, simple, visible,
without moods, unchangeable, in a constant communication and practice
of action and speech.&nbsp; Theirs assuredly is no barren or futile
loss, and they have a conviction, and they bestow the conviction, of
solitude deferred.</p>
<p>Who has painted solitude so that the solitary seemed to stand alone
and inaccessible?&nbsp; There is the loneliness of the shepherdess in
many a drawing of J.F. Millet.&nbsp; The little figure is away, aloof.&nbsp;
The girl stands so when the painter is gone.&nbsp; She waits so on the
sun for the closing of the hours of pasture.&nbsp; Millet has her as
she looks, out of sight.</p>
<p>Now, although solitude is a prepared, secured, defended, elaborate
possession of the rich, they too deny themselves the natural solitude
of a woman with a child.&nbsp; A newly-born child is so nursed and talked
about, handled and jolted and carried about by aliens, and there is
so much importunate service going forward, that a woman is hardly alone
long enough to become aware, in recollection, how her own blood moves
separately, beside her, with another rhythm and different pulses.&nbsp;
All is commonplace until the doors are closed upon the two.&nbsp; This
unique intimacy is a profound retreat, an absolute seclusion.&nbsp;
It is more than single solitude; it is a redoubled isolation more remote
than mountains, safer than valleys, deeper than forests, and further
than mid-sea.</p>
<p>That solitude partaken&mdash;the only partaken solitude in the world&mdash;is
the Point of Honour of ethics.&nbsp; Treachery to that obligation and
a betrayal of that confidence might well be held to be the least pardonable
of all crimes.&nbsp; There is no innocent sleep so innocent as sleep
shared between a woman and a child, the little breath hurrying beside
the longer, as a child&rsquo;s foot runs.&nbsp; But the favourite crime
of the sentimentalist is that of a woman against her child.&nbsp; Her
power, her intimacy, her opportunity, that should be her accusers, are
held to excuse her.&nbsp; She gains the most slovenly of indulgences
and the grossest compassion, on the vulgar grounds that her crime was
easy.</p>
<p>Lawless and vain art of a certain kind is apt to claim to-day, by
the way, some such fondling as a heroine of the dock receives from common
opinion.&nbsp; The vain artist had all the opportunities of the situation.&nbsp;
He was master of his own purpose, such as it was; it was his secret,
and the public was not privy to his artistic conscience.&nbsp; He does
violence to the obligations of which he is aware, and which the world
does not know very explicitly.&nbsp; Nothing is easier.&nbsp; Or he
is lawless in a more literal sense, but only hopes the world will believe
that he has a whole code of his own making.&nbsp; It would, nevertheless,
be less unworthy to break obvious rules obviously in the obvious face
of the public, and to abide the common rebuke.</p>
<p>It has just been said that a park is by no means necessary for the
preparation of a country solitude.&nbsp; Indeed, to make those far and
wide and long approaches and avenues to peace seems to be a denial of
the accessibility of what should be so simple.&nbsp; A step, a pace
or so aside, is enough to lead thither.</p>
<p>A park insists too much, and, besides, does not insist very sincerely.&nbsp;
In order to fulfil the apparent professions and to keep the published
promise of a park, the owner thereof should be a lover of long seclusion
or of a very life of loneliness.&nbsp; He should have gained the state
of solitariness which is a condition of life quite unlike any other.&nbsp;
The traveller who may have gone astray in countries where an almost
life-long solitude is possible knows how invincibly apart are the lonely
figures he has seen in desert places there.&nbsp; Their loneliness is
broken by his passage, it is true, but hardly so to them.&nbsp; They
look at him, but they are not aware that he looks at them.&nbsp; Nay,
they look at him as though they were invisible.&nbsp; Their un-self-consciousness
is absolute; it is in the wild degree.&nbsp; They are solitaries, body
and soul; even when they are curious, and turn to watch the passer-by,
they are essentially alone.&nbsp; Now, no one ever found that attitude
in a squire&rsquo;s figure, or that look in any country gentleman&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; The squire is not a life-long solitary.&nbsp; He never bore
himself as though he were invisible.&nbsp; He never had the impersonal
ways of a herdsman in the remoter Apennines, with a blind, blank hut
in the rocks for his dwelling.&nbsp; Millet would not even have taken
him as a model for a solitary in the briefer and milder sylvan solitudes
of France.&nbsp; And yet nothing but a life-long, habitual, and wild
solitariness would be quite proportionate to a park of any magnitude.</p>
<p>If there is a look of human eyes that tells of perpetual loneliness,
so there is also the familiar look that is the sign of perpetual crowds.&nbsp;
It is the London expression, and, in its way, the Paris expression.&nbsp;
It is the quickly caught, though not interested, look, the dull but
ready glance of those who do not know of their forfeited place apart;
who have neither the open secret nor the close; no reserve, no need
of refuge, no flight nor impulse of flight; no moods but what they may
brave out in the street, no hope of news from solitary counsels.</p>
<h2>DECIVILIZED</h2>
<p>The difficulty of dealing&mdash;in the course of any critical duty&mdash;with
decivilized man lies in this: when you accuse him of vulgarity&mdash;sparing
him no doubt the word&mdash;he defends himself against the charge of
barbarism.&nbsp; Especially from new soil&mdash;remote, colonial&mdash;he
faces you, bronzed, with a half conviction of savagery, partly persuaded
of his own youthfulness of race.&nbsp; He writes, and recites, poems
about ranches and canyons; they are designed to betray the recklessness
of his nature and to reveal the good that lurks in the lawless ways
of a young society.&nbsp; He is there to explain himself, voluble, with
a glossary for his own artless slang.&nbsp; But his colonialism is only
provincialism very articulate.&nbsp; The new air does but make old decadences
seem more stale; the young soil does but set into fresh conditions the
ready-made, the uncostly, the refuse feeling of a race decivilizing.&nbsp;
He who played long this pattering part of youth, hastened to assure
you with so self-denying a face he did not wear war-paint and feathers,
that it became doubly difficult to communicate to him that you had suspected
him of nothing wilder than a second-hand (figurative) dress coat.&nbsp;
And when it was a question not of rebuke, but of praise, even the American
was ill-content with the word of the judicious who lauded him for some
delicate successes in continuing something of the literature of England,
something of the art of France; he was more eager for the applause that
stimulated him to write poems in prose form and to paint panoramic landscape,
after brief training in academies of native inspiration.&nbsp; Even
now English voices are constantly calling upon America to begin&mdash;to
begin, for the world is expectant.&nbsp; Whereas there is no beginning
for her, but instead a fine and admirable continuity which only a constant
care can guide into sustained advance.</p>
<p>But decivilized man is not peculiar to new soil.&nbsp; The English
town, too, knows him in all his dailiness.&nbsp; In England, too, he
has a literature, an art, a music, all his own&mdash;derived from many
and various things of price.&nbsp; Trash, in the fullness of its insimplicity
and cheapness, is impossible without a beautiful past.&nbsp; Its chief
characteristic&mdash;which is futility, not failure&mdash;could not
be achieved but by the long abuse, the rotatory reproduction, the quotidian
disgrace, of the utterances of Art, especially the utterance by words.&nbsp;
Gaiety, vigour, vitality, the organic quality, purity, simplicity, precision&mdash;all
these are among the antecedents of trash.&nbsp; It is after them; it
is also, alas, because of them.&nbsp; And nothing can be much sadder
that such a proof of what may possibly be the failure of derivation.</p>
<p>Evidently we cannot choose our posterity.&nbsp; Reversing the steps
of time, we may, indeed choose backwards.&nbsp; We may give our thoughts
noble forefathers.&nbsp; Well begotten, well born our fancies must be;
they shall be also well derived.&nbsp; We have a voice in decreeing
our inheritance, and not our inheritance only, but our heredity.&nbsp;
Our minds may trace upwards and follow their ways to the best well-heads
of the arts.&nbsp; The very habit of our thoughts may be persuaded one
way unawares by their antenatal history.&nbsp; Their companions must
be lovely, but need be no lovelier than their ancestors; and being so
fathered and so husbanded, our thoughts may be intrusted to keep the
counsels of literature.</p>
<p>Such is our confidence in a descent we know.&nbsp; But, of a sequel
which of us is sure?&nbsp; Which of us is secured against the dangers
of subsequent depreciation?&nbsp; And, moreover, which of us shall trace
the contemporary tendencies, the one towards honour, the other towards
dishonour?&nbsp; Or who shall discover why derivation becomes degeneration,
and where and when and how the bastardy befalls?&nbsp; The decivilized
have every grace as the antecedent of their vulgarities, every distinction
as the precedent of their mediocrities.&nbsp; No ballad-concert song,
feign it sigh, frolic, or laugh, but has the excuse that the feint was
suggested, was made easy, by some living sweetness once.&nbsp; Nor are
the decivilized to blame as having in their own persons possessed civilization
and marred it.&nbsp; They did not possess it; they were born into some
tendency to derogation, into an inclination for things mentally inexpensive.&nbsp;
And the tendency can hardly do other than continue.</p>
<p>Nothing can look duller than the future of this second-hand and multiplying
world.&nbsp; Men need not be common merely because they are many; but
the infection of commonness once begun in the many, what dullness in
their future!&nbsp; To the eye that has reluctantly discovered this
truth&mdash;that the vulgarized are not <i>un</i>-civilized, and that
there is no growth for them&mdash;it does not look like a future at
all.&nbsp; More ballad-concerts, more quaint English, more robustious
barytone songs, more piecemeal pictures, more colonial poetry, more
young nations with withered traditions.&nbsp; Yet it is before this
prospect that the provincial overseas lifts up his voice in a boast
or a promise common enough among the incapable young, but pardonable
only in senility.&nbsp; He promises the world a literature, an art,
that shall be new because his forest is untracked and his town just
built.&nbsp; But what the newness is to be he cannot tell.&nbsp; Certain
words were dreadful once in the mouth of desperate old age.&nbsp; Dreadful
and pitiable as the threat of an impotent king, what shall we name them
when they are the promise of an impotent people?&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
do such things: what they are yet I know not.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THE SPIRIT OF PLACE</h2>
<p>With mimicry, with praises, with echoes, or with answers, the poets
have all but outsung the bells.&nbsp; The inarticulate bell has found
too much interpretation, too many rhymes professing to close with her
inaccessible utterance, and to agree with her remote tongue.&nbsp; The
bell, like the bird, is a musician pestered with literature.</p>
<p>To the bell, moreover, men do actual violence.&nbsp; You cannot shake
together a nightingale&rsquo;s notes, or strike or drive them into haste,
nor can you make a lark toll for you with intervals to suit your turn,
whereas wedding-bells are compelled to seem gay by mere movement and
hustling.&nbsp; I have known some grim bells, with not a single joyous
note in the whole peal, so forced to hurry for a human festival, with
their harshness made light of, as though the Bishop of Hereford had
again been forced to dance in his boots by a merry highwayman.</p>
<p>The clock is an inexorable but less arbitrary player than the bellringer,
and the chimes await their appointed time to fly&mdash;wild prisoners&mdash;by
twos or threes, or in greater companies.&nbsp; Fugitives&mdash;one or
twelve taking wing&mdash;they are sudden, they are brief, they are gone;
they are delivered from the close hands of this actual present.&nbsp;
Not in vain is the sudden upper door opened against the sky; they are
away, hours of the past.</p>
<p>Of all unfamiliar bells, those which seem to hold the memory most
surely after but one hearing are bells of an unseen cathedral of France
when one has arrived by night; they are no more to be forgotten than
the bells in &ldquo;Parsifal.&rdquo;&nbsp; They mingle with the sound
of feet in unknown streets, they are the voices of an unknown tower;
they are loud in their own language.&nbsp; The spirit of place, which
is to be seen in the shapes of the fields and the manner of the crops,
to be felt in a prevalent wind, breathed in the breath of the earth,
overheard in a far street-cry or in the tinkle of some black-smith,
calls out and peals in the cathedral bells.&nbsp; It speaks its local
tongue remotely, steadfastly, largely, clamorously, loudly, and greatly
by these voices; you hear the sound in its dignity, and you know how
familiar, how childlike, how life-long it is in the ears of the people.&nbsp;
The bells are strange, and you know how homely they must be.&nbsp; Their
utterances are, as it were, the classics of a dialect.</p>
<p>Spirit of place!&nbsp; It is for this we travel, to surprise its
subtlety; and where it is a strong and dominant angel, that place, seen
once, abides entire in the memory with all its own accidents, its habits,
its breath, its name.&nbsp; It is recalled all a lifetime, having been
perceived a week, and is not scattered but abides, one living body of
remembrance.&nbsp; The untravelled spirit of place&mdash;not to be pursued,
for it never flies, but always to be discovered, never absent, without
variation&mdash;lurks in the by-ways and rules over the towers, indestructible,
an indescribable unity.&nbsp; It awaits us always in its ancient and
eager freshness.&nbsp; It is sweet and nimble within its immemorial
boundaries, but it never crosses them.&nbsp; Long white roads outside
have mere suggestions of it and prophecies; they give promise not of
its coming, for it abides, but of a new and singular and unforeseen
goal for our present pilgrimage, and of an intimacy to be made.&nbsp;
Was ever journey too hard or too long that had to pay such a visit?&nbsp;
And if by good fortune it is a child who is the pilgrim, the spirit
of place gives him a peculiar welcome, for antiquity and the conceiver
of antiquity (who is only a child) know one another; nor is there a
more delicate perceiver of locality than a child.&nbsp; He is well used
to words and voices that he does not understand, and this is a condition
of his simplicity; and when those unknown words are bells, loud in the
night, they are to him as homely and as old as lullabies.</p>
<p>If, especially in England, we make rough and reluctant bells go in
gay measures, when we whip them to run down the scale to ring in a wedding&mdash;bells
that would step to quite another and a less agile march with a better
grace&mdash;there are belfries that hold far sweeter companies.&nbsp;
If there is no music within Italian churches, there is a most curious
local immemorial music in many a campanile on the heights.&nbsp; Their
way is for the ringers to play a tune on the festivals, and the tunes
are not hymn tunes or popular melodies, but proper bell-tunes, made
for bells.&nbsp; Doubtless they were made in times better versed than
ours in the sub-divisions of the arts, and better able to understand
the strength that lies ready in the mere little submission to the means
of a little art, and to the limits&mdash;nay, the very embarrassments&mdash;of
those means.&nbsp; If it were but possible to give here a real bell-tune&mdash;which
cannot be, for those melodies are rather long&mdash;the reader would
understand how some village musician of the past used his narrow means
as a composer for the bells, with what freshness, completeness, significance,
fancy, and what effect of liberty.</p>
<p>These hamlet-bells are the sweetest, as to their own voices, in the
world.&nbsp; Then I speak of their antiquity I use the word relatively.&nbsp;
The belfries are no older than the sixteenth or seventeenth century,
the time when Italy seems to have been generally rebuilt.&nbsp; But,
needless to say, this is antiquity for music, especially in Italy.&nbsp;
At that time they must have had foundries for bells of tender voices,
and pure, warm, light, and golden throats, precisely tuned.&nbsp; The
hounds of Theseus had not a more just scale, tuned in a peal, than a
North Italian belfry holds in leash.&nbsp; But it does not send them
out in a mere scale, it touches them in the order of the game of a charming
melody.&nbsp; Of all cheerful sounds made by man this is by far the
most light-hearted.&nbsp; You do not hear it from the great churches.&nbsp;
Giotto&rsquo;s coloured tower in Florence, that carries the bells for
Santa Maria del Fiore and Brunelleschi&rsquo;s silent dome, does not
ring more than four contralto notes, tuned with sweetness, depth, and
dignity, and swinging one musical phrase which softly fills the country.</p>
<p>The village belfry it is that grows so fantastic and has such nimble
bells.&nbsp; Obviously it stands alone with its own village, and can
therefore hear its own tune from beginning to end.&nbsp; There are no
other bells in earshot.&nbsp; Other such dovecote-doors are suddenly
set open to the cloud, on a <i>festa</i> morning, to let fly those soft-voiced
flocks, but the nearest is behind one of many mountains, and our local
tune is uninterrupted.&nbsp; Doubtless this is why the little, secluded,
sequestered art of composing melodies for bells&mdash;charming division
of an art, having its own ends and means, and keeping its own wings
for unfolding by law&mdash;dwells in these solitary places.&nbsp; No
tunes in a town would get this hearing, or would be made clear to the
end of their frolic amid such a wide and lofty silence.</p>
<p>Nor does every inner village of Italy hold a bell-tune of its own;
the custom is Ligurian.&nbsp; Nowhere so much as in Genoa does the nervous
tourist complain of church bells in the morning, and in fact he is made
to hear an honest rout of them betimes.&nbsp; But the nervous tourist
has not, perhaps, the sense of place, and the genius of place does not
signal to him to go and find it among innumerable hills, where one by
one, one by one, the belfries stand and play their tunes.&nbsp; Variable
are those lonely melodies, having a differing gaiety for the festivals;
and a pitiful air is played for the burial of a villager.</p>
<p>As for the poets, there is but one among so many of their bells that
seems to toll with a spiritual music so loud as to be unforgotten when
the mind goes up a little higher than the earth, to listen in thought
to earth&rsquo;s untethered sounds.&nbsp; This is Milton&rsquo;s curfew,
that sways across one of the greatest of all the seashores of poetry&mdash;&ldquo;the
wide-watered.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>POPULAR BURLESQUE</h2>
<p>The more I consider that strange inversion of idolatry which is the
motive of Guy Fawkes Day and which annually animates the by-streets
with the sound of processionals and of recessionals&mdash;a certain
popular version of &ldquo;Lest we forget&rdquo; their unvaried theme;
the more I hear the cries of derision raised by the makers of this likeness
of something unworshipful on the earth beneath, so much the more am
I convinced that the national humour is that of banter, and that no
other kind of mirth so gains as does this upon the public taste.</p>
<p>Here, for example, is the popular idea of a street festival; that
day is as the people will actually have it, with their own invention,
their own material, their own means, and their own spirit.&nbsp; They
owe nothing on this occasion to the promptings or the subscriptions
of the classes that are apt to take upon themselves the direction and
tutelage of the people in relation to any form of art.&nbsp; Here on
every fifth of November the people have their own way with their own
art; and their way is to offer the service of the image-maker, reversed
in hissing and irony, to some creature of their hands.</p>
<p>It is a wanton fancy; and perhaps no really barbarous people is capable
of so overturning the innocent plan of original portraiture.&nbsp; To
make a mental image of all things that are named to the ear, or conceived
in the mind, being an industrious custom of children and childish people
which lapses in the age of much idle reading, the making of a material
image is the still more diligent and more sedulous act, whereby the
primitive man controls and caresses his own fancy.&nbsp; He may take
arms anon, disappointed, against his own work; but did he ever do that
work in malice from the outset?</p>
<p>From the statue to the doll, images are all outraged in the person
of the guy.&nbsp; If it were but an antithesis to the citizen&rsquo;s
idea of something admirable which he might carry in procession on some
other day, the carrying of the guy would be less gloomy; but he would
hoot at a suspicion that he might admire anything so much as to make
a good-looking doll in its praise.&nbsp; There is absolutely no image-making
art in the practice of our people, except only this art of rags and
contumely.&nbsp; Or, again, if the revenge taken upon a guy were that
of anger for a certain cause, the destruction would not be the work
of so thin an annual malice and of so heartless a rancour.</p>
<p>But the single motive is that popular irony which becomes daily&mdash;or
so it seems&mdash;more and more the holiday temper of the majority.&nbsp;
Mockery is the only animating impulse, and a loud incredulity is the
only intelligence.&nbsp; They make an image of some one in whom they
do not believe, to deride it.&nbsp; Say that the guy is the effigy of
an agitator in the cause of something to be desired; the street man
and boy have then two motives of mocking: they think the reform to be
not worth doing, and they are willing to suspect the reformer of some
kind of hypocrisy.&nbsp; Perhaps the guy of this occasion is most characteristic
of all guys in London.&nbsp; The people, having him or her to deride,
do not even wait for the opportunity of their annual procession.&nbsp;
They anticipate time, and make an image when it is not November, and
sell it at the market of the kerb.</p>
<p>Hear, moreover, the songs which some nameless one makes for the citizens,
perhaps in thoughtful renunciation of the making of their laws.&nbsp;
These, too, seem to have for their inspiration the universal taunt.&nbsp;
They are, indeed, most in vogue when they have no meaning at all&mdash;this
it is that makes the <i>succ&egrave;s</i> <i>fou</i> (and here Paris
is of one mind with London) of the street; but short of such a triumph,
and when a meaning is discernible, it is an irony.</p>
<p>Bank Holiday courtship (if the inappropriate word can be pardoned)
seems to be done, in real life, entirely by banter.&nbsp; And it is
the strangest thing to find that the banter of women by men is the most
mocking in the exchange.&nbsp; If the burlesque of the maid&rsquo;s
tongue is provocative, that of the man&rsquo;s is derisive.&nbsp; Somewhat
of the order of things as they stood before they were inverted seems
to remain, nevertheless, as a memory; nay, to give the inversion a kind
of lagging interest.&nbsp; Irony is made more complete by the remembrance,
and by an implicit allusion to the state of courtship in other classes,
countries, or times.&nbsp; Such an allusion no doubt gives all its peculiar
twang to the burlesque of love.</p>
<p>With the most strange submission these Englishwomen in their millions
undergo all degrees of derision from the tongues of men who are their
mates, equals, contemporaries, perhaps in some obscure sense their suitors,
and in a strolling manner, with one knows not what ungainly motive of
reserve, even their admirers.&nbsp; Nor from their tongues only; for,
to pass the time, the holiday swain annoys the girl; and if he wears
her hat, it is ten to one that he has plucked it off with a humorous
disregard of her dreadful pins.</p>
<p>We have to believe that unmocked love has existence in the streets,
because of the proof that is published when a man shoots a woman who
has rejected him; and from this also do we learn to believe that a woman
of the burlesque classes is able to reject.&nbsp; But for that sign
we should find little or nothing intelligible in what we see or overhear
of the drama of love in popular life.</p>
<p>In its easy moments, in its leisure, at holiday time, it baffles
all tradition, and shows us the spirit of comedy clowning after a fashion
that is insular and not merely civic.&nbsp; You hear the same twang
in country places; and whether the English maid, having, like the antique,
thrown her apple at her shepherd, run into the thickets of Hampstead
Heath or among sylvan trees, it seems that the most humorous thing to
be done by the swain would be, in the opinion in vogue, to stroll another
way.&nbsp; Insular I have said, because I have not seen the like of
this fashion whether in America or elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>But the chief inversion of all, proved summarily by the annual inversion
of the worship of images on the fifth of November, is that of a sentence
of Wordsworth&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;We live by admiration.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>HAVE PATIENCE, LITTLE SAINT</h2>
<p>Some considerable time must have gone by since any kind of courtesy
ceased, in England, to be held necessary in the course of communication
with a beggar.&nbsp; Feeling may be humane, and the interior act most
gentle; there may be a tacit apology, and a profound misgiving unexpressed;
a reluctance not only to refuse but to be arbiter; a dislike of the
office; a regret, whether for the unequal distribution of social luck
or for a purse left at home, equally sincere; howbeit custom exacts
no word or sign, nothing whatever of intercourse.&nbsp; If a dog or
a cat accosts you, or a calf in a field comes close to you with a candid
infant face and breathing nostrils of investigation, or if any kind
of animal comes to you on some obscure impulse of friendly approach,
you acknowledge it.&nbsp; But the beggar to whom you give nothing expects
no answer to a question, no recognition of his presence, not so much
as the turn of your eyelid in his direction, and never a word to excuse
you.</p>
<p>Nor does this blank behaviour seem savage to those who are used to
nothing else.&nbsp; Yet it is somewhat more inhuman to refuse an answer
to the beggar&rsquo;s remark than to leave a shop without &ldquo;Good
morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; When complaint is made of the modern social manner&mdash;that
it has no merit but what is negative, and that it is apt even to abstain
from courtesy with more lack of grace than the abstinence absolutely
requires&mdash;the habit of manner towards beggars is probably not so
much as thought of.&nbsp; To the simply human eye, however, the prevalent
manner towards beggars is a striking thing; it is significant of so
much.</p>
<p>Obviously it is not easy to reply to begging except by the intelligible
act of giving.&nbsp; We have not the ingenuous simplicity that marks
the caste answering more or less to that of Vere de Vere, in Italy,
for example.&nbsp; An elderly Italian lady on her slow way from her
own ancient ancestral <i>palazzo</i> to the village, and accustomed
to meet, empty-handed, a certain number of beggars, answers them by
a retort which would be, literally translated, &ldquo;Excuse me, dear;
I, too, am a poor devil,&rdquo; and the last word she naturally puts
into the feminine.</p>
<p>Moreover, the sentence is spoken in all the familiarity of the local
dialect&mdash;a dialect that puts any two people at once upon equal
terms as nothing else can do it.&nbsp; Would it were possible to present
the phrase to English readers in all its own helpless good-humour.&nbsp;
The excellent woman who uses it is practising no eccentricity thereby,
and raises no smile.&nbsp; It is only in another climate, and amid other
manners, that one cannot recall it without a smile.&nbsp; To a mind
having a lively sense of contrast it is not a little pleasant to imagine
an elderly lady of corresponding station in England replying so to importunities
for alms; albeit we have nothing answering to the good fellowship of
a broad patois used currently by rich and poor, and yet slightly grotesque
in the case of all speakers&mdash;a dialect in which, for example, no
sermon is ever preached, and in which no book is ever printed, except
for fun; a dialect &ldquo;familiar, but by no means vulgar.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Besides, even if our Englishwoman could by any possibility bring herself
to say to a mendicant, &ldquo;Excuse me, dear; I, too, am a poor devil,&rdquo;
she would still not have the opportunity of putting the last word punctually
into the feminine, which does so complete the character of the sentence.</p>
<p>The phrase at the head of this paper is the far more graceful phrase
of excuse customary in the courteous manners of Portugal.&nbsp; And
everywhere in the South, where an almost well-dressed old woman, who
suddenly begins to beg from you when you least expected it, calls you
&ldquo;my daughter,&rdquo; you can hardly reply without kindness.&nbsp;
Where the tourist is thoroughly well known, doubtless the company of
beggars are used to savage manners in the rich; but about the byways
and remoter places there must still be some dismay at the anger, the
silence, the indignation, and the inexpensive haughtiness wherewith
the opportunity of alms-giving is received by travellers.</p>
<p>In nothing do we show how far the West is from the East so emphatically
as we show it by our lofty ways towards those who so manifestly put
themselves at our feet.&nbsp; It is certainly not pleasant to see them
there; but silence or a storm of impersonal protest&mdash;a protest
that appeals vaguely less to the beggars than to some not impossible
police&mdash;does not seem the most appropriate manner of rebuking them.&nbsp;
We have, it may be, a scruple on the point of human dignity, compromised
by the entreaty and the thanks of the mendicant; but we have a strange
way of vindicating that dignity when we refuse to man, woman, or child
the recognition of a simply human word.&nbsp; Nay, our offence is much
the greater of the two.&nbsp; It is not merely a rough and contemptuous
intercourse, it is the refusal of intercourse&mdash;the last outrage.&nbsp;
How do we propose to redress those conditions of life that annoy us
when a brother whines, if we deny the presence, the voice, and the being
of this brother, and if, because fortune has refused him money, we refuse
him existence?</p>
<p>We take the matter too seriously, or not seriously enough, to hold
it in the indifference of the wise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have patience, little
saint,&rdquo; is a phrase that might teach us the cheerful way to endure
our own unintelligible fortunes in the midst, say, of the population
of a hill-village among the most barren of the Maritime Alps, where
huts of stone stand among the stones of an unclothed earth, and there
is no sign of daily bread.&nbsp; The people, albeit unused to travellers,
yet know by instinct what to do, and beg without the delay of a moment
as soon as they see your unwonted figure.&nbsp; Let it be taken for
granted that you give all you can; some form of refusal becomes necessary
at last, and the gentlest&mdash;it is worth while to remember&mdash;is
the most effectual.&nbsp; An indignant tourist, one who to the portent
of a puggaree which, perhaps, he wears on a grey day, adds that of ungovernable
rage, is so wild a visitor that no attempt at all is made to understand
him; and the beggars beg dismayed but unalarmed, uninterruptedly, without
a pause or a conjecture.&nbsp; They beg by rote, thinking of something
else, as occasion arises, and all indifferent to the violence of the
rich.</p>
<p>It is the merry beggar who has so lamentably disappeared.&nbsp; If
a beggar is still merry anywhere, he hides away what it would so cheer
and comfort us to see; he practises not merely the conventional seeming,
which is hardly intended to convince, but a more subtle and dramatic
kind of semblance, of no good influence upon the morals of the road.&nbsp;
He no longer trusts the world with a sight of his gaiety.&nbsp; He is
not a wholehearted mendicant, and no longer keeps that liberty of unstable
balance whereby an unattached creature can go in a new direction with
a new wind.&nbsp; The merry beggar was the only adventurer free to yield
to the lighter touches of chance, the touches that a habit of resistance
has made imperceptible to the seated and stable social world.</p>
<p>The visible flitting figure of the unfettered madman sprinkled our
literature with mad songs, and even one or two poets of to-day have,
by tradition, written them; but that wild source of inspiration has
been stopped; it has been built over, lapped and locked, imprisoned,
led underground.&nbsp; The light melancholy and the wind-blown joys
of the song of the distraught, which the poets were once ingenious to
capture, have ceased to sound one note of liberty in the world&rsquo;s
ears.&nbsp; But it seems that the grosser and saner freedom of the happy
beggar is still the subject of a Spanish song.</p>
<p>That song is gay, not defiant it is not an outlaw&rsquo;s or a robber&rsquo;s,
it is not a song of violence or fear.&nbsp; It is the random trolling
note of a man who owes his liberty to no disorder, failure, or ill-fortune,
but takes it by choice from the voluntary world, enjoys it at the hand
of unreluctant charity; who twits the world with its own choice of bonds,
but has not broken his own by force.&nbsp; It seems, therefore, the
song of an indomitable liberty of movement, light enough for the puffs
of a zephyr chance.</p>
<h2>AT MONASTERY GATES</h2>
<p>No woman has ever crossed the inner threshold, or shall ever cross
it, unless a queen, English or foreign, should claim her privilege.&nbsp;
Therefore, if a woman records here the slighter things visible of the
monastic life, it is only because she was not admitted to see more than
beautiful courtesy and friendliness were able to show her in guest-house
and garden.</p>
<p>The Monastery is of fresh-looking Gothic, by Pugin&mdash;the first
of the dynasty: it is reached by the white roads of a limestone country,
and backed by a young plantation, and it gathers its group of buildings
in a cleft high up among the hills of Wales.&nbsp; The brown habit is
this, and these are the sandals, that come and go by hills of finer,
sharper, and loftier line, edging the dusk and dawn of an Umbrian sky.&nbsp;
Just such a Via Crucis climbs the height above Orta, and from the foot
of its final crucifix you can see the sunrise touch the top of Monte
Rosa, while the encircled lake below is cool with the last of the night.&nbsp;
The same order of friars keep that sub-Alpine Monte Sacro, and the same
have set the Kreuzberg beyond Bonn with the same steep path by the same
fourteen chapels, facing the Seven Mountains and the Rhine.</p>
<p>Here, in North Wales, remote as the country is, with the wheat green
over the blunt hill-tops, and the sky vibrating with larks, a long wing
of smoke lies round the horizon.&nbsp; The country, rather thinly and
languidly cultivated above, has a valuable sub-soil, and is burrowed
with mines; the breath of pit and factory, out of sight, thickens the
lower sky, and lies heavily over the sands of Dee.&nbsp; It leaves the
upper blue clear and the head of Orion, but dims the flicker of Sirius
and shortens the steady ray of the evening star.&nbsp; The people scattered
about are not mining people, but half-hearted agriculturists, and very
poor.&nbsp; Their cottages are rather cabins; not a tiled roof is in
the country, but the slates have taken some beauty with time, having
dips and dimples, and grass upon their edges.&nbsp; The walls are all
thickly whitewashed, which is a pleasure to see.&nbsp; How willingly
would one swish the harmless whitewash over more than half the colour&mdash;over
all the chocolate and all the blue&mdash;with which the buildings of
the world are stained!&nbsp; You could not wish for a better, simpler,
or fresher harmony than whitewash makes with the slight sunshine and
the bright grey of an English sky.</p>
<p>The grey-stone, grey-roofed monastery looks young in one sense&mdash;it
is modern; and the friars look young in another&mdash;they are like
their brothers of an earlier time.&nbsp; No one, except the journalists
of yesterday, would spend upon them those tedious words, &ldquo;quaint,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;old world.&rdquo;&nbsp; No such weary adjectives are spoken
here, unless it be by the excursionists.</p>
<p>With large aprons tied over their brown habits, the Lay Brothers
work upon their land, planting parsnips in rows, or tending a prosperous
bee-farm.&nbsp; A young friar, who sang the High Mass yesterday, is
gaily hanging the washed linen in the sun.&nbsp; A printing press, and
a machine which slices turnips, are at work in an outhouse, and the
yard thereby is guarded by a St Bernard, whose single evil deed was
that under one of the obscure impulses of a dog&rsquo;s heart&mdash;atoned
for by long and self-conscious remorse&mdash;he bit the poet; and tried,
says one of the friars, to make doggerel of him.&nbsp; The poet, too,
lives at the monastery gates, and on monastery ground, in a seclusion
which the tidings of the sequence of his editions hardly reaches.&nbsp;
There is no disturbing renown to be got among the cabins of the Flintshire
hills.&nbsp; Homeward, over the verge, from other valleys, his light
figure flits at nightfall, like a moth.</p>
<p>To the coming and going of the friars, too, the village people have
become well used, and the infrequent excursionists, for lack of intelligence
and of any knowledge that would refer to history, look at them without
obtrusive curiosity.&nbsp; It was only from a Salvation Army girl that
you heard the brutal word of contempt.&nbsp; She had come to the place
with some companions, and with them was trespassing, as she was welcome
to do, within the monastery grounds.&nbsp; She stood, a figure for Bournemouth
pier, in her grotesque bonnet, and watched the son of the Umbrian saint&mdash;the
friar who walks among the Giotto frescoes at Assisi and between the
cypresses of Bello Sguardo, and has paced the centuries continually
since the coming of the friars.&nbsp; One might have asked of her the
kindness of a fellow-feeling.&nbsp; She and he alike were so habited
as to show the world that their life was aloof from its &ldquo;idle
business.&rdquo;&nbsp; By some such phrase, at least, the friar would
assuredly have attempted to include her in any spiritual honours ascribed
to him.&nbsp; Or one might have asked of her the condescension of forbearance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only fancy,&rdquo; said the Salvation Army girl, watching the
friar out of sight, &ldquo;only fancy making such a fool of one&rsquo;s
self!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great hood of the friars, which is drawn over the head in Zurbaran&rsquo;s
ecstatic picture, is turned to use when the friars are busy.&nbsp; As
a pocket it relieves the over-burdened hands.&nbsp; A bottle of the
local white wine made by the brotherhood at Genoa, and sent to this
house by the West, is carried in the cowl as a present to the stranger
at the gates.&nbsp; The friars tell how a brother resolved, at Shrovetide,
to make pancakes, and not only to make, but also to toss them.&nbsp;
Those who chanced to be in the room stood prudently aside, and the brother
tossed boldly.&nbsp; But that was the last that was seen of his handiwork.&nbsp;
Victor Hugo sings in <i>La</i> <i>L&eacute;gende</i> <i>des</i> <i>Si&egrave;cles</i>
of disappearance as the thing which no creature is able to achieve:
here the impossibility seemed to be accomplished by quite an ordinary
and a simple pancake.&nbsp; It was clean gone, and there was an end
of it.&nbsp; Nor could any explanation of this ceasing of a pancake
from the midst of the visible world be so much as divined by the spectators.&nbsp;
It was only when the brother, in church, knelt down to meditate and
drew his cowl about his head that the accident was explained.</p>
<p>Every midnight the sweet contralto bells call the community, who
get up gaily to this difficult service.&nbsp; Of all duties this one
never grows easy or familiar, and therefore never habitual.&nbsp; It
is something to have found but one act aloof from habit.&nbsp; It is
not merely that the friars overcome the habit of sleep.&nbsp; The subtler
point is that they can never acquire the habit of sacrificing sleep.&nbsp;
What art, what literature, or what life but would gain a secret security
by such a point of perpetual freshness and perpetual initiative?&nbsp;
It is not possible to get up at midnight without a will that is new
night by night.&nbsp; So should the writer&rsquo;s work be done, and,
with an intention perpetually unique, the poet&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The contralto bells have taught these Western hills the &ldquo;Angelus&rdquo;
of the French fields, and the hour of night&mdash;<i>l&rsquo;ora</i>
<i>di</i> <i>notte</i>&mdash;which rings with so melancholy a note from
the village belfries on the Adriatic littoral, when the latest light
is passing.&nbsp; It is the prayer for the dead: &ldquo;Out of the depths
have I cried unto Thee, O Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little flocks of novices, on paschal evenings, are folded to
the sound of that evening prayer.&nbsp; The care of them is the central
work of the monastery, which is placed in so remote a country because
it is principally a place of studies.&nbsp; So much elect intellect
and strength of heart withdrawn from the traffic of the world!&nbsp;
True, the friars are not doing the task which Carlyle set mankind as
a refuge from despair.&nbsp; These &ldquo;bearded counsellors of God&rdquo;
keep their cells, read, study, suffer, sing, hold silence; whereas they
might be &ldquo;operating&rdquo;&mdash;beautiful word!&mdash;upon the
Stock Exchange, or painting Academy pictures, or making speeches, or
reluctantly jostling other men for places.&nbsp; They might be among
the involuntary busybodies who are living by futile tasks the need whereof
is a discouraged fiction.&nbsp; There is absolutely no limit to the
superfluous activities, to the art, to the literature, implicitly renounced
by the dwellers within such walls as these.&nbsp; The output&mdash;again
a beautiful word&mdash;of the age is lessened by this abstention.&nbsp;
None the less hopes the stranger and pilgrim to pause and knock once
again upon those monastery gates.</p>
<h2>THE SEA WALL</h2>
<p>A singular love of walls is mine.&nbsp; Perhaps because of childish
association with mountain-climbing roads narrow in the bright shadows
of grey stone, hiding olive trees whereof the topmost leaves prick above
into the blue; or perhaps because of subsequent living in London, with
its too many windows and too few walls, the city which of all capitals
takes least visible hold upon the ground; or for the sake of some other
attraction or aversion, walls, blank and strong, reaching outward at
the base, are a satisfaction to the eyes teased by the inexpressive
peering of windows, by that weak lapse and shuffling which is the London
&ldquo;area,&rdquo; and by the helpless hollows of shop-fronts.</p>
<p>I would rather have a wall than any rail but a very good one of wrought-iron.&nbsp;
A wall is the safeguard of simplicity.&nbsp; It lays a long level line
among the indefinite chances of the landscape.&nbsp; But never more
majestic than in face of the wild sea, the wall, steadying its slanting
foot upon the rock, builds in the serried ilex-wood and builds out the
wave.&nbsp; The sea-wall is the wall at its best.&nbsp; And fine as
it is on the strong coast, it is beautiful on the weak littoral and
the imperilled levels of a northern beach.</p>
<p>That sea wall is low and long; sea-pinks grow on the salt grass that
passes away into shingle at its foot.&nbsp; It is at close quarters
with the winter sea, when, from the low coast with its low horizon,
the sky-line of sea is jagged.&nbsp; Never from any height does the
ocean-horizon show thus broken and battered at its very verge, but from
the flat coast and the narrow world you can see the wave as far as you
can see the water; and the stormy light of a clear horizon is seen to
be mobile and shifting with the buoyant hillocks and their restless
line.</p>
<p>Nowhere in Holland does there seem to be such a low sea-wall as secures
many a mile of gentle English coast to the east.&nbsp; The Dutch dyke
has not that aspect of a lowly parapet against a tide; it springs with
a look of haste and of height; and when you first run upstairs from
the encumbered Dutch fields to look at the sea, there is nothing in
the least like England; and even the Englishman of to-day is apt to
share something of the old perversity that was minded to cast derision
upon the Dutch in their encounters with the tides.</p>
<p>There has been some fault in the Dutch, making them subject to the
slight derision of the nations who hold themselves to be more romantic,
and, as it were, more slender.&nbsp; We English, once upon a time, did
especially flout the little nation then acting a history that proved
worth the writing.&nbsp; It may be no more than a brief perversity that
has set a number of our writers to cheer the memory of Charles II.&nbsp;
Perhaps, even, it is no more than another rehearsal of that untiring
success at the expense of the bourgeois.&nbsp; The bourgeois would be
more simple than, in fact, he is were he to stand up every time to be
shocked; but, perhaps, the image of his dismay is enough to reward the
fancy of those who practise the wanton art.&nbsp; And, when all is done,
who performs for any but an imaginary audience?&nbsp; Surely those companies
of spectators and of auditors are not the least of the makings of an
author.&nbsp; A few men and women he achieves within his books; but
others does he create without, and to those figures of all illusion
makes the appeal of his art.&nbsp; More candid is the author who has
no world, but turns that appeal inwards to his own heart.&nbsp; He has
at least a living hearer.</p>
<p>This is by the way.&nbsp; Charles II has been cheered; the feat is
done, the dismay is imagined with joy.&nbsp; And yet the Merry Monarch&rsquo;s
was a dismal time.&nbsp; Plague, fire, the arrears of pension from the
French King remembered and claimed by the restored throne of England,
and the Dutch in the Medway&mdash;all this was disaster.&nbsp; None
the less, having the vanity of new clothes and a pretty figure, did
we&mdash;especially by the mouth of Andrew Marvell&mdash;deride our
victors, making sport of the Philistines with a proper national sense
of enjoyment of such physical disabilities, or such natural difficulties,
or such misfavour of fortune, as may beset the alien.</p>
<p>Especially were the denials of fortune matter for merriment.&nbsp;
They are so still; or they were so certainly in the day when a great
novelist found the smallness of some South German States to be the subject
of unsating banter.&nbsp; The German scenes at the end of &ldquo;Vanity
Fair,&rdquo; for example, may prove how much the ridicule of mere smallness,
fewness, poverty (and not even real poverty, privation, but the poverty
that shows in comparison with the gold of great States, and is properly
in proportion) rejoiced the sense of humour in a writer and moralist
who intended to teach mankind to be less worldly.&nbsp; In Andrew Marvell&rsquo;s
day they were even more candid.&nbsp; The poverty of privation itself
was provocative of the sincere laughter of the inmost man, the true,
infrequent laughter of the heart.&nbsp; Marvell, the Puritan, laughed
that very laughter&mdash;at leanness, at hunger, cold, and solitude&mdash;in
the face of the world, and in the name of literature, in one memorable
satire.&nbsp; I speak of &ldquo;Flecno, an English Priest in Rome,&rdquo;
wherein nothing is spared&mdash;not the smallness of the lodging, nor
the lack of a bed, nor the scantiness of clothing, nor the fast.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This basso-rilievo of a man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>personal meagreness is the first joke and the last.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at that he should find in the smallness
of the country of Holland matter for a cordial jest.&nbsp; But, besides
the smallness, there was that accidental and natural disadvantage in
regard to the sea.&nbsp; In the Venetians, commerce with the sea, conflict
with the sea, a victory over the sea, and the ensuing peace&mdash;albeit
a less instant battle and a more languid victory&mdash;were confessed
to be noble; in the Dutch they were grotesque.&nbsp; &ldquo;With mad
labour,&rdquo; says Andrew Marvell, with the spirited consciousness
of the citizen of a country well above ground and free to watch the
labour at leisure, &ldquo;with mad labour&rdquo; did the Dutch &ldquo;fish
the land to shore.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>How did they rivet with gigantic piles,<br />
Thorough the centre, their new-catched miles,<br />
And to the stake a struggling country bound,<br />
Where barking waves still bait the forced ground;<br />
Building their watery Babel far more high<br />
To reach the sea than those to scale the sky!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is done with a jolly wit, and in what admirable couplets!</p>
<blockquote><p>The fish oft-times the burgher dispossessed,<br />
And sat, not as a meat, but as a guest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is even better sport that the astonished tritons and sea-nymphs
should find themselves provided with a capital <i>cabillau</i> of shoals
of pickled Dutchmen (heeren for herring, says Marvell); and it must
be allowed that he rhymes with the enjoyment of irony.&nbsp; There is
not a smile for us in &ldquo;Flecno,&rdquo; but it is more than possible
to smile over this &ldquo;Character of Holland&rdquo;; at the excluded
ocean returning to play at leap-frog over the steeples; at the rise
of government and authority in Holland, which belonged of right to the
man who could best invent a shovel or a pump, the country being so leaky:-</p>
<blockquote><p>Not who first sees the rising sun commands,<br />
But who could first discern the rising lands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have lost something more than the delighted laughter of Marvell,
more than his practical joke, and more than the heart that was light
in so burly a frame&mdash;we have lost with these the wild humour that
wore so well the bonds of two equal lines, and was wild with so much
order, invention, malice, gaiety, polish, equilibrium, and vitality&mdash;in
a word, the Couplet, the couplet of the past.&nbsp; We who cannot stand
firm within two lines, but must slip beyond and between the boundaries,
who tolerate the couplets of Keats and imitate them, should praise the
day of Charles II because of Marvell&rsquo;s art, and not for love of
the sorry reign.&nbsp; We had plague, fire, and the Dutch in the Medway,
but we had the couplet; and there were also the measures of those more
poetic poets, hitherto called somewhat slightingly the Cavalier poets,
who matched the wit of the Puritan with a spirit simpler and less mocking.</p>
<p>It was against an English fortress, profoundly walled, that some
remembered winter storms lately turned their great artillery.&nbsp;
It was a time of resounding nights; the sky was so clamorous and so
close, up in the towers of the seaside stronghold, that one seemed to
be indeed admitted to the perturbed counsels of the winds.&nbsp; The
gale came with an indescribable haste, hooting as it flew; it seemed
to break itself upon the heights, yet passed unbroken out to sea; in
the voice of the sea there were pauses, but none in that of the urgent
gale with its hoo-hoo-hoo all night, that clamoured down the calling
of the waves.&nbsp; That lack of pauses was the strangest thing in the
tempest, because the increase of sound seemed to imply a lull before.&nbsp;
The lull was never perceptible, but the lift was always an alarm.&nbsp;
The onslaught was instant, where would it stop?&nbsp; What was the secret
extreme to which this hurry and force were tending?&nbsp; You asked
less what thing was driving the flocks of the storm than what was drawing
them.&nbsp; The attraction seemed the greater violence, the more irresistible,
and the more unknown.&nbsp; And there were moments when the end seemed
about to be attained.</p>
<p>The wind struck us hasty blows, and unawares we borrowed, to describe
it, words fit for the sharp strokes of material things; but the fierce
gale is soft.&nbsp; Along the short grass, trembling and cowering flat
on the scarped hill-side, against the staggering horse, against the
flint walls, one with the rock they grasp, the battery of the tempest
is a quick and enormous softness.&nbsp; What down, what sand, what deep
moss, what elastic wave could match the bed and cushion of the gale?</p>
<p>This storm tossed the wave and the stones of the sea-wall up together.&nbsp;
The next day it left the waters white with the thrilling whiteness of
foam in sunshine.&nbsp; It was only the Channel; and in such narrow
waters you do not see the distances, the wide levels of fleeting and
floating foam, that lie light between long wave and long wave on a Mediterranean
coast, regions of delicate and transitory brightness so far out that
all the waves, near and far, seem to be breaking at the same moment,
one beyond the other, and league beyond league, into foam.&nbsp; But
the Channel has its own strong, short curl that catches the rushing
shingle up with the freshest of all noises and runs up with sudden curves,
white upon the white sea-wall, under the random shadow of sea-gulls
and the light of a shining cloud.</p>
<h2>TITHONUS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It was resolved,&rdquo; said the morning paper, &ldquo;to
colour the borders of the panels and other spaces of Portland stone
with arabesques and other patterns, but that no paint should be used,
as paint would need renewing from time to time.&nbsp; The colours, therefore,&rdquo;&mdash;and
here is the passage to be noted&mdash;&ldquo;are all mixed with wax
liquefied with petroleum; and the wax surface sets as hard as marble.
. . The wax is left time to form an imperishable surface of ornament,
which would have to be cut out of the stone with a chisel if it was
desired to remove it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not, apparently, that a new surface
is formed which, by much violence and perseverance, could, years hence,
be chipped off again; but that the &ldquo;ornament&rdquo; is driven
in and incorporate, burnt in and absorbed, so that there is nothing
possible to cut away by any industry.&nbsp; In this humorous form of
ornament we are beforehand with Posterity.&nbsp; Posterity is baffled.</p>
<p>Will this victory over our sons&rsquo; sons be the last resolute
tyranny prepared by one age for the coercion, constraint, and defeat
of the future?&nbsp; To impose that compulsion has been hitherto one
of the strongest of human desires.&nbsp; It is one, doubtless, to be
outgrown by the human race; but how slowly that growth creeps onwards,
let this success in the stencilling of St Paul&rsquo;s teach us, to
our confusion.&nbsp; There is evidently a man&mdash;a group of men&mdash;happy
at this moment because it has been possible, by great ingenuity, to
force our posterity to have their cupola of St Paul&rsquo;s with the
stone mouldings stencilled and &ldquo;picked out&rdquo; with niggling
colours, whether that undefended posterity like it or not.&nbsp; And
this is a survival of one of the obscure pleasures of man, attested
by history.</p>
<p>It is impossible to read the Thirty-nine Articles, for example, and
not to recognize in those acts of final, all-resolute, eager, eternal
legislation one of the strongest of all recorded proofs of this former
human wish.&nbsp; If Galileo&rsquo;s Inquisitors put a check upon the
earth, which yet moved, a far bolder enterprise was the Reformers&rsquo;
who arrested the moving man, and inhibited the moving God.&nbsp; The
sixteenth century and a certain part of the age immediately following
seem to be times when the desire had conspicuously become a passion.&nbsp;
Say the middle of the sixteenth century in Italy and the beginning of
the seventeenth in England&mdash;for in those days we were somewhat
in the rear.&nbsp; <i>There</i> is the obstinate, confident, unreluctant,
undoubting, and resolved seizure upon power.&nbsp; <i>Then</i> was Rome
rebuilt, re-faced, marked with a single sign and style.&nbsp; Then was
many a human hand stretched forth to grasp the fate of the unborn.&nbsp;
The fortunes and the thoughts of the day to come were to be as the day
then present would have them, if the dead hand&mdash;the living hand
that was then to die, and was to keep its hold in death&mdash;could
by any means make them fast.</p>
<p>Obviously, to build at all is to impose something upon an age that
may be more than willing to build for itself.&nbsp; The day may soon
come when no man will do even so much without some impulse of apology.&nbsp;
Posterity is not compelled to keep our pictures or our books in existence,
nor to read nor to look at them; but it is more or less obliged to have
a stone building in view for an age or two.&nbsp; We can hardly avoid
some of the forms of tyranny over the future, but few, few are the living
men who would consent to share in this horrible ingenuity at St Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;this
petroleum and this wax.</p>
<p>In 1842 they were discussing the decoration of the Houses of Parliament,
and the efforts of all in council were directed upon the future.&nbsp;
How the frescoes then to be achieved by the artists of the day should
be made secure against all mischances&mdash;smoke, damp, &ldquo;the
risk of bulging,&rdquo; even accidents attending the washing of upper
floors&mdash;all was discussed in confidence with the public.&nbsp;
It was impossible for anyone who read the papers then to escape from
some at least of the responsibilities of technical knowledge.&nbsp;
From Genoa, from Rome, from Munich especially, all kinds of expert and
most deliberate schemes were gathered in order to defeat the natural
and not superfluous operation of efficient and effacing time.</p>
<p>The academic little capital of Bavaria had, at about the same date,
decorated a vast quantity of wall space of more than one order of architecture.&nbsp;
Art revived and was encouraged at that time and place with unparalleled
obstinacy.&nbsp; They had not the malice of the petroleum that does
violence to St Paul&rsquo;s; but they had instead an indomitable patience.&nbsp;
Under the commands of the master Cornelius, they baffled time and all
his work&mdash;refused his pardons, his absolutions, his cancelling
indulgences&mdash;by a perseverance that nothing could discourage.&nbsp;
Who has not known somewhat indifferent painters mighty busy about their
colours and varnishes?&nbsp; Cornelius caused a pit to be dug for the
preparation of the lime, and in the case of the Ludwig Kirche this lime
remained there for eight years, with frequent stirrings.&nbsp; This
was in order that the whole fresco, when at last it was entrusted to
its bed, should be set there for immortality.&nbsp; Nor did the master
fail to thwart time by those mechanical means that should avert the
risk of bulging already mentioned.&nbsp; He neglected no detail.&nbsp;
He was provident, and he lay in wait for more than one of the laws of
nature, to frustrate them.&nbsp; Gravitation found him prepared, and
so did the less majestic but not vain dispensation of accidents.&nbsp;
Against bulging he had an underplot of tiles set on end; against possible
trickling from an upper floor he had asphalt; it was all part of the
human conspiracy.&nbsp; In effect, the dull pictures at Munich seem
to stand well.&nbsp; It would have been more just&mdash;so the present
age thinks of these preserved walls&mdash;if the day that admired them
had had them exclusively, and our day had been exempt.&nbsp; The painted
cathedrals of the Middle Ages have undergone the natural correction;
why not the Ludwig Kirche?</p>
<p>In 1842, then, the nations were standing, as it were, shoulder to
shoulder against the walk of time and against his gentle act and art.&nbsp;
They had just called iron into their cabal.&nbsp; Cornelius came from
Munich to London, looked at the walls at Westminster, and put a heart
of confidence into the breast of the Commission.&nbsp; The situation,
he averred, need not be too damp for immortality, with due care.&nbsp;
What he had done in the Glyptothek and in the Pinacothek might be done
with the best results in England, in defiance of the weather, of the
river, of the mere days, of the divine order of alteration, and, in
a word, of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was that good servant of the law of change, lime
that had not been kept quite long enough, ready to fulfil its mission;
they would have none of it.&nbsp; They evaded it, studied its ways,
and put it to the rout.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many failures that might have been
hastily attributed to damp were really owing to the use of lime in too
fresh a state.&nbsp; Of the experimental works painted at Munich, those
only have faded which are known to have been done without due attention
to the materials.&nbsp; <i>Thus</i>, <i>a</i> <i>figure</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Bavaria</i>, <i>painted</i> <i>by</i> <i>Kaulbach</i>, <i>which</i>
<i>has</i> <i>faded</i> <i>considerably</i>, <i>is</i> <i>known</i>
<i>to</i> <i>have</i> <i>been</i> <i>executed</i> <i>with</i> <i>lime</i>
<i>that</i> <i>was</i> <i>too</i> <i>fresh</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One cannot
refrain from italics: the way was so easy; it was only to take a little
less of this important care about the lime, to have a better confidence,
to be more impatient and eager, and all had been well: <i>not</i> to
do&mdash;a virtue of omission.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of art-criticism.&nbsp; It is an ethical question
hitherto unstudied.&nbsp; The makers of laws have not always been obliged
to face it, inasmuch as their laws are made in part for the present,
and in part for that future whereof the present needs to be assured&mdash;that
is, the future is bound as a guaranty for present security of person
or property.&nbsp; Some such hold upon the time to come we are obliged
to claim, and to claim it for our own sakes&mdash;because of the reflex
effect upon our own affairs, and not for the pleasure of fettering the
time to come.&nbsp; Every maker of a will does at least this.</p>
<p>Were the men of the sixteenth century so moderate?&nbsp; Not they.&nbsp;
They found the present all too narrow for the imposition of their will.&nbsp;
It did not satisfy them to disinter and scatter the bones of the dead,
nor to efface the records of a past that offended them.&nbsp; It did
not satisfy them to bind the present to obedience by imperative menace
and instant compulsion.&nbsp; When they had burnt libraries and thrown
down monuments and pursued the rebels of the past into the other world,
and had seen to it that none living should evade them, then they outraged
the future.</p>
<p>Whatever misgivings may have visited those dominant minds as to the
effectual and final success of their measures&mdash;would their writ
run in time as well as place, and were the nameless populations indeed
their subjects?&mdash;whatever questions may have peered in upon those
rigid counsels and upon those busy vigils of the keepers of the world,
they silenced by legislation and yet more legislation.&nbsp; They wrote
in statute books; they would have written their will across the skies.&nbsp;
Their hearts would have burnt for lack of records more inveterate, and
of testimonials that mankind should lack courage to question, if in
truth they did ever doubt lest posterity might try their lock.&nbsp;
Perhaps they did never so much as foresee the race of the unnumbered
and emancipated for whom their prohibitions and penalties are no more
than documents of history.</p>
<p>If the tyrannous day of our fathers had but possessed the means of
these our more diffident times!&nbsp; They, who would have written their
present and actual will upon the skies, might certainly have written
it in petroleum and wax upon the stone.&nbsp; Fate did them wrong in
withholding from their hands this means of finality and violence.&nbsp;
Into our hands it has been given at a time when the student of the race
thought, perhaps, that we had been proved in the school of forbearance.&nbsp;
Something, indeed, we may have learnt therein, but not enough, as we
now find.</p>
<p>We have not yet the natural respect for the certain knowledge and
the probable wisdom of our successors.&nbsp; A certain reverend official
document, not guiltless of some confusion of thought, lately recommended
to the veneration of the present times &ldquo;those past ages with their
store of experience.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doubtless, as the posterity of their
predecessors our predecessors had experience, but, as our ancestors,
none&mdash;none.&nbsp; Therefore, if they were a little reverend our
own posterity is right reverend.&nbsp; It is a flippant and novelty-loving
humour that so flatters the unproved past and refuses the deference
due to the burden of years which is ours, which&mdash;grown still graver&mdash;will
be our children&rsquo;s.</p>
<h2>SYMMETRY AND INCIDENT</h2>
<p>The art of Japan has none but an exterior part in the history of
the art of nations.&nbsp; Being in its own methods and attitude the
art of accident, it has, appropriately, an accidental value.&nbsp; It
is of accidental value, and not of integral necessity.&nbsp; The virtual
discovery of Japanese art, during the later years of the second French
Empire, caused Europe to relearn how expedient, how delicate, and how
lovely Incident may look when Symmetry has grown vulgar.&nbsp; The lesson
was most welcome.&nbsp; Japan has had her full influence.&nbsp; European
art has learnt the value of position and the tact of the unique.&nbsp;
But Japan is unlessoned, and (in all her characteristic art) content
with her own conventions; she is local, provincial, alien, remote, incapable
of equal companionship with a world that has Greek art in its own history&mdash;Pericles
&ldquo;to its father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor is it pictorial art, or decorative art only, that has been touched
by Japanese example of Incident and the Unique.&nbsp; Music had attained
the noblest form of symmetry in the eighteenth century, but in music,
too, symmetry had since grown dull; and momentary music, the music of
phase and of fragment, succeeded.&nbsp; The sense of symmetry is strong
in a complete melody&mdash;of symmetry in its most delicate and lively
and least stationary form&mdash;balance; whereas the <i>leit</i>-<i>motif</i>
is isolated.&nbsp; In domestic architecture Symmetry and Incident make
a familiar antithesis&mdash;the very commonplace of rival methods of
art.&nbsp; But the same antithesis exists in less obvious forms.&nbsp;
The poets have sought &ldquo;irregular&rdquo; metres.&nbsp; Incident
hovers, in the very act of choosing its right place, in the most modern
of modern portraits.&nbsp; In these we have, if not the Japanese suppression
of minor emphasis, certainly the Japanese exaggeration of major emphasis;
and with this a quickness and buoyancy.&nbsp; The smile, the figure,
the drapery&mdash;not yet settled from the arranging touch of a hand,
and showing its mark&mdash;the restless and unstationary foot, and the
unity of impulse that has passed everywhere like a single breeze, all
these have a life that greatly transcends the life of Japanese art,
yet has the nimble touch of Japanese incident.&nbsp; In passing, a charming
comparison may be made between such portraiture and the aspect of an
aspen or other tree of light and liberal leaf; whether still or in motion
the aspen and the free-leafed poplar have the alertness and expectancy
of flight in all their flocks of leaves, while the oaks and elms are
gathered in their station.&nbsp; All this is not Japanese, but from
such accident is Japanese art inspired, with its good luck of perceptiveness.</p>
<p>What symmetry is to form, that is repetition in the art of ornament.&nbsp;
Greek art and Gothic alike have series, with repetition or counterchange
for their ruling motive.&nbsp; It is hardly necessary to draw the distinction
between this motive and that of the Japanese.&nbsp; The Japanese motives
may be defined as uniqueness and position.&nbsp; And these were not
known as motives of decoration before the study of Japanese decoration.&nbsp;
Repetition and counterchange, of course, have their place in Japanese
ornament, as in the diaper patterns for which these people have so singular
an invention, but here, too, uniqueness and position are the principal
inspiration.&nbsp; And it is quite worth while, and much to the present
purpose, to call attention to the chief peculiarity of the Japanese
diaper patterns, which is <i>interruption</i>.&nbsp; Repetition there
must necessarily be in these, but symmetry is avoided by an interruption
which is, to the Western eye, at least, perpetually and freshly unexpected.&nbsp;
The place of the interruptions of lines, the variation of the place,
and the avoidance of correspondence, are precisely what makes Japanese
design of this class inimitable.&nbsp; Thus, even in a repeating pattern,
you have a curiously successful effect of impulse.&nbsp; It is as though
a separate intention had been formed by the designer at every angle.&nbsp;
Such renewed consciousness does not make for greatness.&nbsp; Greatness
in design has more peace than is found in the gentle abruptness of Japanese
lines, in their curious brevity.&nbsp; It is scarcely necessary to say
that a line, in all other schools of art, is long or short according
to its place and purpose; but only the Japanese designer so contrives
his patterns that the line is always short; and many repeating designs
are entirely composed of this various and variously-occurring brevity,
this prankish avoidance of the goal.&nbsp; Moreover, the Japanese evade
symmetry, in the unit of their repeating patterns, by another simple
device&mdash;that of numbers.&nbsp; They make a small difference in
the number of curves and of lines.&nbsp; A great difference would not
make the same effect of variety; it would look too much like a contrast.&nbsp;
For example, three rods on one side and six on another would be something
else than a mere variation, and variety would be lost by the use of
them.&nbsp; The Japanese decorator will vary three in this place by
two in that, and a sense of the defeat of symmetry is immediately produced.&nbsp;
With more violent means the idea of symmetry would have been neither
suggested nor refuted.</p>
<p>Leaving mere repeating patterns and diaper designs, you find, in
Japanese compositions, complete designs in which there is no point of
symmetry.&nbsp; It is a balance of suspension and of antithesis.&nbsp;
There is no sense of lack of equilibrium, because place is, most subtly,
made to have the effect of giving or of subtracting value.&nbsp; A small
thing is arranged to reply to a large one, for the small thing is placed
at the precise distance that makes it a (Japanese) equivalent.&nbsp;
In Italy (and perhaps in other countries) the scales commonly in use
are furnished with only a single weight that increases or diminishes
in value according as you slide it nearer or farther upon a horizontal
arm.&nbsp; It is equivalent to so many ounces when it is close to the
upright, and to so many pounds when it hangs from the farther end of
the horizontal rod.&nbsp; Distance plays some such part with the twig
or the bird in the upper corner of a Japanese composition.&nbsp; Its
place is its significance and its value.&nbsp; Such an art of position
implies a great art of intervals.&nbsp; The Japanese chooses a few things
and leaves the space between them free, as free as the pauses or silences
in music.&nbsp; But as time, not silence, is the subject, or material,
of contrast in musical pauses, so it is the measurement of space&mdash;that
is, collocation&mdash;that makes the value of empty intervals.&nbsp;
The space between this form and that, in a Japanese composition, is
valuable because it is just so wide and no more.&nbsp; And this, again,
is only another way of saying that position is the principle of this
apparently wilful art.</p>
<p>Moreover, the alien art of Japan, in its pictorial form, has helped
to justify the more stenographic school of etching.&nbsp; Greatly transcending
Japanese expression, the modern etcher has undoubtedly accepted moral
support from the islands of the Japanese.&nbsp; He too etches a kind
of shorthand, even though his notes appeal much to the spectator&rsquo;s
knowledge, while the Oriental shorthand appeals to nothing but the spectator&rsquo;s
simple vision.&nbsp; Thus the two artists work in ways dissimilar.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the French etcher would never have written his signs so
freely had not the Japanese so freely drawn his own.&nbsp; Furthermore
still, the transitory and destructible material of Japanese art has
done as much as the multiplication of newspapers, and the discovery
of processes, to reconcile the European designer&mdash;the black and
white artist&mdash;to working for the day, the day of publication.&nbsp;
Japan lives much of its daily life by means of paper, painted; so does
Europe by means of paper, printed.&nbsp; But as we, unlike those Orientals,
are a destructive people, paper with us means short life, quick abolition,
transformation, re-appearance, a very circulation of life.&nbsp; This
is our present way of surviving ourselves&mdash;the new version of that
feat of life.&nbsp; Time was when to survive yourself meant to secure,
for a time indefinitely longer than the life of man, such dull form
as you had given to your work; to intrude upon posterity.&nbsp; To survive
yourself, to-day, is to let your work go into daily oblivion.</p>
<p>Now, though the Japanese are not a destructive people, their paper
does not last for ever, and that material has clearly suggested to them
a different condition of ornament from that with which they adorned
old lacquer, fine ivory, or other perdurable things.&nbsp; For the transitory
material they keep the more purely pictorial art of landscape.&nbsp;
What of Japanese landscape?&nbsp; Assuredly it is too far reduced to
a monotonous convention to merit the serious study of races that have
produced Cotman and Corot.&nbsp; Japanese landscape-drawing reduces
things seen to such fewness as must have made the art insuperably tedious
to any people less fresh-spirited and more inclined to take themselves
seriously than these Orientals.&nbsp; A preoccupied people would never
endure it.&nbsp; But a little closer attention from the Occidental student
might find for their evasive attitude towards landscape&mdash;it is
an attitude almost traitorously evasive&mdash;a more significant reason.&nbsp;
It is that the distances, the greatness, the winds and the waves of
the world, coloured plains, and the flight of a sky, are all certainly
alien to the perceptions of a people intent upon little deformities.&nbsp;
Does it seem harsh to define by that phrase the curious Japanese search
for accidents?&nbsp; Upon such search these people are avowedly intent,
even though they show themselves capable of exquisite appreciation of
the form of a normal bird and of the habit of growth of a normal flower.&nbsp;
They are not in search of the perpetual slight novelty which was Aristotle&rsquo;s
ideal of the language poetic (&ldquo;a little wildly, or with the flower
of the mind,&rdquo; says Emerson of the way of a poet&rsquo;s speech)&mdash;and
such novelty it is, like the frequent pulse of the pinion, that keeps
verse upon the wing; no, what the Japanese are intent upon is perpetual
slight disorder.&nbsp; In Japan the man in the fields has eyes less
for the sky and the crescent moon than for some stone in the path, of
which the asymmetry strikes his curious sense of pleasure in fortunate
accident of form.&nbsp; For love of a little grotesque strangeness he
will load himself with the stone and carry it home to his garden.&nbsp;
The art of such a people is not liberal art, not the art of peace, and
not the art of humanity.&nbsp; Look at the curls and curves whereby
this people conventionally signify wave or cloud.&nbsp; All these curls
have an attitude which is like that of a figure slightly malformed,
and not like that of a human body that is perfect, dominant, and if
bent, bent at no lowly or niggling labour.&nbsp; Why these curves should
be so charming it would be hard to say; they have an exquisite prankishness
of variety, the place where the upward or downward scrolls curl off
from the main wave is delicately unexpected every time, and&mdash;especially
in gold embroideries&mdash;is sensitively fit for the material, catching
and losing the light, while the lengths of waving line are such as the
long gold threads take by nature.</p>
<p>A moment ago this art was declared not human.&nbsp; And, in fact,
in no other art has the figure suffered such crooked handling.&nbsp;
The Japanese have generally evaded even the local beauty of their own
race for the sake of perpetual slight deformity.&nbsp; Their beauty
is remote from our sympathy and admiration; and it is quite possible
that we might miss it in pictorial presentation, and that the Japanese
artist may have intended human beauty where we do not recognise it.&nbsp;
But if it is not easy to recognise, it is certainly not difficult to
guess at.&nbsp; And, accordingly, you are generally aware that the separate
beauty of the race, and its separate dignity, even&mdash;to be very
generous&mdash;has been admired by the Japanese artist, and is represented
here and there occasionally, in the figure of warrior or mousm&eacute;.&nbsp;
But even with this exception the habit of Japanese figure-drawing is
evidently grotesque, derisive, and crooked.&nbsp; It is curious to observe
that the search for slight deformity is so constant as to make use,
for its purposes, not of action only, but of perspective foreshortening.&nbsp;
With us it is to the youngest child only that there would appear to
be mirth in the drawing of a man who, stooping violently forward, would
seem to have his head &ldquo;beneath his shoulders.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
European child would not see fun in the living man so presented, but&mdash;unused
to the same effect &ldquo;in the flat&rdquo;&mdash;he thinks it prodigiously
humorous in a drawing.&nbsp; But so only when he is quite young.&nbsp;
The Japanese keeps, apparently, his sense of this kind of humour.&nbsp;
It amuses him, but not perhaps altogether as it amuses the child, that
the foreshortened figure should, in drawing and to the unpractised eye,
seem distorted and dislocated; the simple Oriental appears to find more
derision in it than the simple child.&nbsp; The distortion is not without
a suggestion of ignominy.&nbsp; And, moreover, the Japanese shows derision,
but not precisely scorn.&nbsp; He does not hold himself superior to
his hideous models.&nbsp; He makes free with them on equal terms.&nbsp;
He is familiar with them.</p>
<p>And if this is the conviction gathered from ordinary drawings, no
need to insist upon the ignoble character of those that are intentional
caricatures.</p>
<p>Perhaps the time has hardly come for writing anew the praises of
symmetry.&nbsp; The world knows too much of the abuse of Greek decoration,
and would be glad to forget it, with the intention of learning that
art afresh in a future age and of seeing it then anew.&nbsp; But whatever
may be the phases of the arts, there is the abiding principle of symmetry
in the body of man, that goes erect, like an upright soul.&nbsp; Its
balance is equal.&nbsp; Exterior human symmetry is surely a curious
physiological fact where there is no symmetry interiorly.&nbsp; For
the centres of life and movement within the body are placed with Oriental
inequality.&nbsp; Man is Greek without and Japanese within.&nbsp; But
the absolute symmetry of the skeleton and of the beauty and life that
cover it is accurately a principle.&nbsp; It controls, but not tyrannously,
all the life of human action.&nbsp; Attitude and motion disturb perpetually,
with infinite incidents&mdash;inequalities of work, war, and pastime,
inequalities of sleep&mdash;the symmetry of man.&nbsp; Only in death
and &ldquo;at attention&rdquo; is that symmetry complete in attitude.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, it rules the dance and the battle, and its rhythm is not
to be destroyed.&nbsp; All the more because this hand holds the goad
and that the harrow, this the shield and that the sword, because this
hand rocks the cradle and that caresses the unequal heads of children,
is this rhythm the law; and grace and strength are inflections thereof.&nbsp;
All human movement is a variation upon symmetry, and without symmetry
it would not be variation; it would be lawless, fortuitous, and as dull
and broadcast as lawless art.&nbsp; The order of inflection that is
not infraction has been explained in a most authoritative sentence of
criticism of literature, a sentence that should save the world the trouble
of some of its futile, violent, and weak experiments: &ldquo;Law, the
rectitude of humanity,&rdquo; says Mr Coventry Patmore, &ldquo;should
be the poet&rsquo;s only subject, as, from time immemorial, it has been
the subject of true art, though many a true artist has done the Muse&rsquo;s
will and knew it not.&nbsp; As all the music of verse arises, not from
infraction but from inflection of the law of the set metre; so the greatest
poets have been those the <i>modulus</i> of whose verse has been most
variously and delicately inflected, in correspondence with feelings
and passions which are the inflections of moral law in their theme.&nbsp;
Law puts a strain upon feeling, and feeling responds with a strain upon
law.&nbsp; Furthermore, Aristotle says that the quality of poetic language
is a continual <i>slight</i> novelty.&nbsp; In the highest poetry, like
that of Milton, these three modes of inflection, metrical, linguistical,
and moral, all chime together in praise of the truer order of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And like that order is the order of the figure of man, an order most
beautiful and most secure when it is put to the proof.&nbsp; That perpetual
proof by perpetual inflection is the very condition of life.&nbsp; Symmetry
is a profound, if disregarded because perpetually inflected, condition
of human life.</p>
<p>The nimble art of Japan is unessential; it may come and go, may settle
or be fanned away.&nbsp; It has life and it is not without law; it has
an obvious life, and a less obvious law.&nbsp; But with Greece abides
the obvious law and the less obvious life: symmetry as apparent as the
symmetry of the form of man, and life occult like his unequal heart.&nbsp;
And this seems to be the nobler and the more perdurable relation.</p>
<h2>THE PLAID</h2>
<p>It is disconcerting to hear of the plaid in India.&nbsp; Our dyes,
we know, they use in the silk mills of Bombay, with the deplorable result
that their old clothes are dull and unintentionally falsified with infelicitous
decay.&nbsp; The Hindus are a washing people; and the sun and water
that do but dim, soften, and warm the native vegetable dyes to the last,
do but burlesque the aniline.&nbsp; Magenta is bad enough when it is
itself; but the worst of magenta is that it spoils but poorly.&nbsp;
No bad modern forms and no bad modern colours spoil well.&nbsp; And
spoiling is an important process.&nbsp; It is a test&mdash;one of the
ironical tests that come too late with their proofs.&nbsp; London portico-houses
will make some such ruins as do chemical dyes, which undergo no use
but derides them, no accidents but caricature them.&nbsp; This is an
old enough grievance.&nbsp; But the plaid!</p>
<p>The plaid is the Scotchman&rsquo;s contribution to the decorative
art of the world.&nbsp; Scotland has no other indigenous decoration.&nbsp;
In his most admirable lecture on &ldquo;The Two Paths,&rdquo; Ruskin
acknowledged, with a passing misgiving, that his Highlanders had little
art.&nbsp; And the misgiving was but passing, because he considered
how fatally wrong was the art of India&mdash;&ldquo;it never represents
a natural fact.&nbsp; It forms its compositions out of meaningless fragments
of colour and flowings of line . . . It will not draw a man, but an
eight-armed monster; it will not draw a flower, but only a spiral or
a zig-zag.&rdquo;&nbsp; Because of this aversion from Nature the Hindu
and his art tended to evil, we read.&nbsp; But of the Scot we are told,
&ldquo;You will find upon reflection that all the highest points of
the Scottish character are connected with impressions derived straight
from the natural scenery of their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What, then, about the plaid?&nbsp; Where is the natural fact there?&nbsp;
If the Indian, by practising a non-natural art of spirals and zig-zags,
cuts himself off &ldquo;from all possible sources of healthy knowledge
or natural delight,&rdquo; to what did the good and healthy Highlander
condemn himself by practising the art of the plaid?&nbsp; A spiral may
be found in the vine, and a zig-zag in the lightning, but where in nature
is the plaid to be found?&nbsp; There is surely no curve or curl that
can be drawn by a designing hand but is a play upon some infinitely
various natural fact.&nbsp; The smoke of the cigarette, more sensitive
in motion than breath or blood, has its waves so multitudinously inflected
and reinflected, with such flights and such delays, it flows and bends
upon currents of so subtle influence and impulse as to include the most
active, impetuous, and lingering curls ever drawn by the finest Oriental
hand&mdash;and that is not a Hindu hand, nor any hand of Aryan race.&nbsp;
The Japanese has captured the curve of the section of a sea-wave&mdash;its
flow, relaxation, and fall; but this is a single movement, whereas the
line of cigarette-smoke in a still room fluctuates in twenty delicate
directions.&nbsp; No, it is impossible to accept the saying that the
poor spiral or scroll of a human design is anything but a participation
in the innumerable curves and curls of nature.</p>
<p>Now the plaid is not only &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; from natural sources,
as Ruskin says of Oriental design&mdash;the plaid is not only cut off
from nature, and cut off from nature by the yard, for it is to be measured
off in inorganic quantity; but it is even a kind of intentional contradiction
of all natural or vital forms.&nbsp; And it is equally defiant of vital
tone and of vital colour.&nbsp; Everywhere in nature tone is gradual,
and between the fainting of a tone and the failing of a curve there
is a charming analogy.&nbsp; But the tartan insists that its tone shall
be invariable, and sharply defined by contrasts of dark and light.&nbsp;
As to colour, it has colours, not colour.</p>
<p>But that plaid should now go so far afield as to decorate the noble
garment of the Indies is ill news.&nbsp; True, Ruskin saw nothing but
cruelty and corruption in Indian life or art; but let us hear an Indian
maxim in regard to those who, in cruel places, are ready sufferers:
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; says the <i>Mahabharata</i>, &ldquo;where women
are treated with respect, the very gods are said to be filled with joy.&nbsp;
Women deserve to be honoured.&nbsp; Serve ye them.&nbsp; Bend your will
before them.&nbsp; By honouring women ye are sure to attain to the fruition
of all things.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the rash teachers of our youth would
have persuaded us that this generous lesson was first learnt in Teutonic
forests!</p>
<p>Nothing but extreme lowliness can well reply, or would probably be
suffered to reply, to this Hindu profession of reverence.&nbsp; Accordingly
the woman so honoured makes an offering of cakes and oil to the souls
of her mother-in-law, grandmother-in-law, and great-grandmother-in-law,
in gratitude for their giving her a good husband.&nbsp; And to go back
for a moment to Ruskin&rsquo;s contrast of the two races, it was assuredly
under the stress of some too rash reasoning that he judged the lovely
art of the East as a ministrant to superstition, cruelty, and pleasure,
whether wrought upon the temple, the sword, or the girdle.&nbsp; The
innocent art of innocent Hindu women for centuries decked their most
modest heads, their dedicated and sequestered beauty, their child-loving
breasts, and consecrated chambers.</p>
<h2>THE FLOWER</h2>
<p>There is a form of oppression that has not until now been confessed
by those who suffer from it or who are participants, as mere witnesses,
in its tyranny.&nbsp; It is the obsession of man by the flower.&nbsp;
In the shape of the flower his own paltriness revisits him&mdash;his
triviality, his sloth, his cheapness, his wholesale habitualness, his
slatternly ostentation.&nbsp; These return to him and wreak upon him
their dull revenges.&nbsp; What the tyranny really had grown to can
be gauged nowhere so well as in country lodgings, where the most ordinary
things of design and decoration have sifted down and gathered together,
so that foolish ornament gains a cumulative force and achieves a conspicuous
commonness.&nbsp; Stem and petal and leaf&mdash;the fluent forms that
a man has not by heart but certainly by rote&mdash;are woven, printed,
cast, and stamped wherever restlessness and insimplicity have feared
to leave plain spaces.&nbsp; The most ugly of all imaginable rooms,
which is probably the parlour of a farm-house arrayed for those whom
Americans call summer-boarders, is beset with flowers.&nbsp; It blooms,
a dry, woollen, papery, cast-iron garden.&nbsp; The floor flourishes
with blossoms adust, poorly conventionalized into a kind of order; the
table-cover is ablaze with a more realistic florescence; the wall-paper
is set with bunches; the rigid machine-lace curtain is all of roses
and lilies in its very construction; over the muslin blinds an impotent
sprig is scattered.&nbsp; In the worsted rosettes of the bell-ropes,
in the plaster picture-frames, in the painted tea-tray and on the cups,
in the pediment of the sideboard, in the ornament that crowns the barometer,
in the finials of sofa and arm-chair, in the finger-plates of the &ldquo;grained&rdquo;
door, is to be seen the ineffectual portrait or to be traced the stale
inspiration of the flower.&nbsp; And what is this bossiness around the
grate but some blunt, black-leaded garland?&nbsp; The recital is wearisome,
but the retribution of the flower is precisely weariness.&nbsp; It is
the persecution of man, the haunting of his trivial visions, and the
oppression of his inconsiderable brain.</p>
<p>The man so possessed suffers the lot of the weakling&mdash;subjection
to the smallest of the things he has abused.&nbsp; The designer of cheap
patterns is no more inevitably ridden by the flower than is the vain
and transitory author by the phrase.&nbsp; In literature as in all else
man merits his subjection to trivialities by his economical greed.&nbsp;
A condition for using justly and gaily any decoration would seem to
be a measure of reluctance.&nbsp; Ornament&mdash;strange as the doctrine
sounds in a world decivilized&mdash;was in the beginning intended to
be something jocund; and jocundity was never to be achieved but by postponement,
deference, and modesty.&nbsp; Nor can the prodigality of the meadows
in May be quoted in dispute.&nbsp; For Nature has something even more
severe than modertion: she has an innumerable singleness.&nbsp; Her
buttercup meadows are not prodigal; they show multitude, but not multiplicity,
and multiplicity is exactly the disgrace of decoration.&nbsp; Who has
ever multiplied or repeated his delights? or who has ever gained the
granting of the most foolish of his wishes&mdash;the prayer for reiteration?&nbsp;
It is a curious slight to generous Fate that man should, like a child,
ask for one thing many times.&nbsp; Her answer every time is a resembling
but new and single gift; until the day when she shall make the one tremendous
difference among her gifts&mdash;and make it perhaps in secret&mdash;by
naming one of them the ultimate.&nbsp; What, for novelty, what, for
singleness, what, for separateness, can equal the last?&nbsp; Of many
thousand kisses the poor last&mdash;but even the kisses of your mouth
are all numbered.</p>
<h2>UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM</h2>
<p>It is principally for the sake of the leg that a change in the dress
of man is so much to be desired.&nbsp; The leg, completing as it does
the form of man, should make a great part of that human scenery which
is at least as important as the scenery of geological structure, or
the scenery of architecture, or the scenery of vegetation, but which
the lovers of mountains and the preservers of ancient buildings have
consented to ignore.&nbsp; The leg is the best part of the figure, inasmuch
as it has the finest lines and therewith those slender, diminishing
forms which, coming at the base of the human structure, show it to be
a thing of life by its unstable equilibrium.&nbsp; A lifeless structure
is in stable equilibrium; the body, springing, poised, upon its fine
ankles and narrow feet, never stands without implying and expressing
life.&nbsp; It is the leg that first suggested the phantasy of flight.&nbsp;
We imagine wings to the figure that is erect upon the vital and tense
legs of man; and the herald Mercury, because of his station, looks new-lighted.&nbsp;
All this is true of the best leg, and the best leg is the man&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
That of the young child, in which the Italian schools of painting delighted,
has neither movement nor supporting strength.&nbsp; In the case of the
woman&rsquo;s figure it is the foot, with its extreme proportional smallness,
that gives the precious instability, the spring and balance that are
so organic.&nbsp; But man should no longer disguise the long lines,
the strong forms, in those lengths of piping or tubing that are of all
garments the most stupid.&nbsp; Inexpressive of what they clothe as
no kind of concealing drapery could ever be, they are neither implicitly
nor explicitly good raiment.&nbsp; It is hardly possible to err by violence
in denouncing them.&nbsp; Why, when an indifferent writer is praised
for &ldquo;clothing his thought,&rdquo; it is to modern raiment that
one&rsquo;s agile fancy flies&mdash;fain of completing the metaphor!</p>
<p>The human scenery: yes, costume could make a crowd something other
than the mass of sooty colour&mdash;dark without depth&mdash;and the
multiplication of undignified forms that fill the streets, and demonstrate,
and meet, and listen to the speaker.&nbsp; For the undistinguished are
very important by their numbers.&nbsp; These are they who make the look
of the artificial world.&nbsp; They are man generalized; as units they
inevitably lack something of interest; all the more they have cumulative
effect.&nbsp; It would be well if we could persuade the average man
to take on a certain human dignity in the clothing of his average body.&nbsp;
Unfortunately he will be slow to be changed.&nbsp; And as to the poorer
part of the mass, so wretched are their national customs&mdash;and the
wretchedest of them all the wearing of other men&rsquo;s old raiment&mdash;that
they must wait for reform until the reformed dress, which the reformers
have not yet put on, shall have turned second-hand.</p>
<h2>VICTORIAN CARICATURE</h2>
<p>There has been no denunciation, and perhaps even no recognition,
of a certain social immorality in the caricature of the mid-century
and earlier.&nbsp; Literary and pictorial alike, it had for its aim
the vulgarizing of the married woman.&nbsp; No one now would read Douglas
Jerrold for pleasure, but it is worth while to turn up that humourist&rsquo;s
serial, &ldquo;Mrs. Caudle&rsquo;s Curtain Lectures,&rdquo; which were
presumably considered good comic reading in the &ldquo;Punch&rdquo;
of that time, and to make acquaintance with a certain ideal of the grotesque.&nbsp;
Obviously to make a serious comment on anything which others consider
or have considered humorous is to put oneself at a disadvantage.&nbsp;
He who sees the joke holds himself somewhat the superior of the man
who would see it, such as it is, if he thought it worth his eyesight.&nbsp;
The last-named has to bear the least tolerable of modern reproaches&mdash;that
he lacks humour; but he need not always care.&nbsp; Now to turn over
Douglas Jerrold&rsquo;s monologues is to find that people in the mid-century
took their mirth principally from the life of the <i>arri&egrave;re</i>
<i>boutique</i>.&nbsp; On that shabby stage was enacted the comedy of
literature.&nbsp; Therefore we must take something of the vulgarity
of Jerrold as a circumstance of the social ranks wherein he delighted.&nbsp;
But the essential vulgarity is that of the woman.&nbsp; There is in
some old &ldquo;Punch&rdquo; volume a drawing by Leech&mdash;whom one
is weary of hearing named the gentle, the refined&mdash;where the work
of the artist has vied with the spirit of the letterpress.&nbsp; Douglas
Jerrold treats of the woman&rsquo;s jealousy, Leech of her stays.&nbsp;
They lie on a chair by the bed, beyond description gross.&nbsp; And
page by page the woman is derided, with an unfailing enjoyment of her
foolish ugliness of person, of manners, and of language.&nbsp; In that
time there was, moreover, one great humourist, one whom I infinitely
admire; he, too, I am grieved to remember, bore his part willingly in
vulgarizing the woman; and the part that fell to him was the vulgarizing
of the act of maternity.&nbsp; Woman spiteful, woman suing man at the
law for evading her fatuous companionship, woman incoherent, woman abandoned
without restraint to violence and temper, woman feigning sensibility&mdash;in
none of these ignominies is woman so common and so foolish for Dickens
as she is in child-bearing.</p>
<p>I named Leech but now.&nbsp; He was, in all things essential, Dickens&rsquo;s
contemporary.&nbsp; And accordingly the married woman and her child
are humiliated by his pencil; not grossly, but commonly.&nbsp; For him
she is moderately and dully ridiculous.&nbsp; What delights him as humorous
is that her husband&mdash;himself wearisome enough to die of&mdash;is
weary of her, finds the time long, and tries to escape her.&nbsp; It
amuses him that she should furtively spend money over her own dowdiness,
to the annoyance of her husband, and that her husband should have no
desire to adorn her, and that her mother should be intolerable.&nbsp;
It pleases him that her baby, with enormous cheeks and a hideous rosette
in its hat&mdash;a burlesque baby&mdash;should be a grotesque object
of her love, for that too makes subtly for her abasement.&nbsp; Charles
Keene, again&mdash;another contemporary, though he lived into a later
and different time.&nbsp; He saw little else than common forms of human
ignominy&mdash;indignities of civic physique, of stupid prosperity,
of dress, of bearing.&nbsp; He transmits these things in greater proportion
than he found them&mdash;whether for love of the humour of them, or
by a kind of inverted disgust that is as eager as delight&mdash;one
is not sure which is the impulse.&nbsp; The grossness of the vulgarities
is rendered with a completeness that goes far to convince us of a certain
sensitiveness of apprehension in the designer; and then again we get
convinced that real apprehension&mdash;real apprehensiveness&mdash;would
not have insisted upon such things, could not have lived with them through
almost a whole career.&nbsp; There is one drawing in the &ldquo;Punch&rdquo;
of years ago, in which Charles Keene achieved the nastiest thing possible
to even the invention of that day.&nbsp; A drunken citizen, in the usual
broadcloth, has gone to bed, fully dressed, with his boots on and his
umbrella open, and the joke lies in the surprise awaiting, when she
awakes, the wife asleep at his side in a night-cap.&nbsp; Every one
who knows Keene&rsquo;s work can imagine how the huge well-fed figure
was drawn, and how the coat wrinkled across the back, and how the bourgeois
whiskers were indicated.&nbsp; This obscene drawing is matched by many
equally odious.&nbsp; Abject domesticity, ignominies of married life,
of middle-age, of money-making; the old common jape against the mother-in-law;
abominable weddings: in one drawing a bridegroom with shambling side-long
legs asks his bride if she is nervous; she is a widow, and she answers,
&ldquo;No, never was.&rdquo;&nbsp; In all these things there is very
little humour.&nbsp; Where Keene achieved fun was in the figures of
his schoolboys.&nbsp; The hint of tenderness which in really fine work
could never be absent from a man&rsquo;s thought of a child or from
his touch of one, however frolic or rowdy the subject in hand, is absolutely
lacking in Keene&rsquo;s designs; nevertheless, we acknowledge that
there is humour.&nbsp; It is also in some of his clerical figures when
they are not caricatures, and certainly in &ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; the
City waiter of &ldquo;Punch.&rdquo;&nbsp; But so irresistible is the
derision of the woman that all Charles Keene&rsquo;s persistent sense
of vulgarity is intent centrally upon her.&nbsp; Never for any grace
gone astray is she bantered, never for the social extravagances, for
prattle, or for beloved dress; but always for her jealousy, and for
the repulsive person of the man upon whom she spies and in whom she
vindicates her ignoble rights.&nbsp; If this is the shopkeeper the possession
of whom is her boast, what then is she?</p>
<p>This great immorality, centring in the irreproachable days of the
Exhibition of 1851, or thereabouts&mdash;the pleasure in this particular
form of human disgrace&mdash;has passed, leaving one trace only: the
habit by which some men reproach a silly woman through her sex, whereas
a silly man is not reproached through his sex.&nbsp; But the vulgarity
of which I have written here was distinctively English&mdash;the most
English thing that England had in days when she bragged of many another&mdash;and
it was not able to survive an increased commerce of manners and letters
with France.&nbsp; It was the chief immorality destroyed by the French
novel.</p>
<h2>THE POINT OF HONOUR</h2>
<p>Not without significance is the Spanish nationality of Velasquez.&nbsp;
In Spain was the Point put upon Honour; and Velasquez was the first
Impressionist.&nbsp; As an Impressionist he claimed, implicitly if not
explicitly, a whole series of delicate trusts in his trustworthiness;
he made an appeal to the confidence of his peers; he relied on his own
candour, and asked that the candid should rely upon him; he kept the
chastity of art when other masters were content with its honesty, and
when others saved artistic conscience he safeguarded the point of honour.&nbsp;
Contemporary masters more or less proved their position, and convinced
the world by something of demonstration; the first Impressionist simply
asked that his word should be accepted.&nbsp; To those who would not
take his word he offers no bond.&nbsp; To those who will, he grants
the distinction of a share in his responsibility.</p>
<p>Somewhat unrefined, in comparison with his lofty and simple claim
to be believed on a suggestion, is the commoner painter&rsquo;s production
of his credentials, his appeal to the sanctions of ordinary experience,
his self-defence against the suspicion of making irresponsible mysteries
in art.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can see for yourself,&rdquo; the lesser man
seems to say to the world, &ldquo;thus things are, and I render them
in such manner that your intelligence may be satisfied.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is an appeal to average experience&mdash;at the best the cumulative
experience; and with the average, or with the sum, art cannot deal without
derogation.&nbsp; The Spaniard seems to say: &ldquo;Thus things are
in my pictorial sight.&nbsp; Trust me, I apprehend them so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We are not excluded from his counsels, but we are asked to attribute
a certain authority to him, master of the craft as he is, master of
that art of seeing pictorially which is the beginning and not far from
the end&mdash;not far short of the whole&mdash;of the art of painting.&nbsp;
So little indeed are we shut out from the mysteries of a great Impressionist&rsquo;s
impression that Velasquez requires us to be in some degree his colleagues.&nbsp;
Thus may each of us to whom he appeals take praise from the praised:
he leaves my educated eyes to do a little of the work.&nbsp; He respects
my responsibility no less&mdash;though he respects it less explicitly&mdash;than
I do his.&nbsp; What he allows me would not be granted by a meaner master.&nbsp;
If he does not hold himself bound to prove his own truth, he returns
thanks for my trust.&nbsp; It is as though he used his countrymen&rsquo;s
courteous hyperbole and called his house my own.&nbsp; In a sense of
the most noble hostship he does me the honours of his picture.</p>
<p>Because Impressionism with all its extreme&mdash;let us hope its
ultimate&mdash;derivatives is so free, therefore is it doubly bound.&nbsp;
Because there is none to arraign it, it is a thousand times responsible.&nbsp;
To undertake this art for the sake of its privileges without confessing
its obligations&mdash;or at least without confessing them up to the
point of honour&mdash;is to take a vulgar freedom: to see immunities
precisely where there are duties, and an advantage where there is a
bond.&nbsp; A very mob of men have taken Impressionism upon themselves,
in several forms and under a succession of names, in this our later
day.&nbsp; It is against all probabilities that more than a few among
these have within them the point of honour.&nbsp; In their galleries
we are beset with a dim distrust.&nbsp; And to distrust is more humiliating
than to be distrusted.&nbsp; How many of these landscape-painters, deliberately
rash, are painting the truth of their own impressions?&nbsp; An ethical
question as to loyalty is easily answered; truth and falsehood as to
fact are, happily for the intelligence of the common conscience, not
hard to divide.&nbsp; But when the <i>dubium</i> concerns not fact but
artistic truth, can the many be sure that their sensitiveness, their
candour, their scruple, their delicate equipoise of perceptions, the
vigilance of their apprehension, are enough?&nbsp; Now Impressionists
have told us things as to their impressions&mdash;as to the effect of
things upon the temperament of this man and upon the mood of that&mdash;which
should not be asserted except on the artistic point of honour.&nbsp;
The majority can tell ordinary truth, but should not trust themselves
for truth extraordinary.&nbsp; They can face the general judgement,
but they should hesitate to produce work that appeals to the last judgement,
which is the judgement within.&nbsp; There is too much reason to divine
that a certain number of those who aspire to differ from the greatest
of masters have no temperaments worth speaking of, no point of view
worth seizing, no vigilance worth awaiting, no mood worth waylaying.&nbsp;
And to be, <i>de</i> <i>parti</i> <i>pris</i>, an Impressionist without
these!&nbsp; O Velasquez!&nbsp; Nor is literature quite free from a
like reproach in her own things.&nbsp; An author, here and there, will
make as though he had a word worth hearing&mdash;nay, worth over-hearing&mdash;a
word that seeks to withdraw even while it is uttered; and yet what it
seems to dissemble is all too probably a platitude.&nbsp; But obviously,
literature is not&mdash;as is the craft and mystery of painting&mdash;so
at the mercy of a half-imposture, so guarded by unprovable honour.&nbsp;
For the art of painting is reserved that shadowy risk, that undefined
salvation.&nbsp; If the artistic temperament&mdash;tedious word!&mdash;with
all its grotesque privileges, becomes yet more common than it is, there
will be yet less responsibility; for the point of honour is the simple
secret of the few.</p>
<h2>THE COLOUR OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Red has been praised for its nobility as the colour of life.&nbsp;
But the true colour of life is not red.&nbsp; Red is the colour of violence,
or of life broken open, edited, and published.&nbsp; Or if red is indeed
the colour of life, it is so only on condition that it is not seen.&nbsp;
Once fully visible, red is the colour of life violated, and in the act
of betrayal and of waste.&nbsp; Red is the secret of life, and not the
manifestation thereof.&nbsp; It is one of the things the value of which
is secrecy, one of the talents that are to be hidden in a napkin.&nbsp;
The true colour of life is the colour of the body, the colour of the
covered red, the implicit and not explicit red of the living heart and
the pulses.&nbsp; It is the modest colour of the unpublished blood.</p>
<p>So bright, so light, so soft, so mingled, the gentle colour of life
is outdone by all the colours of the world.&nbsp; Its very beauty is
that it is white, but less white than milk; brown, but less brown than
earth; red, but less red than sunset or dawn.&nbsp; It is lucid, but
less lucid than the colour of lilies.&nbsp; It has the hint of gold
that is in all fine colour; but in our latitudes the hint is almost
elusive.&nbsp; Under Sicilian skies, indeed, it is deeper than old ivory;
but under the misty blue of the English zenith, and the warm grey of
the London horizon, it is as delicately flushed as the paler wild roses,
out to their utmost, flat as stars, in the hedges of the end of June.</p>
<p>For months together London does not see the colour of life in any
mass.&nbsp; The human face does not give much of it, what with features,
and beards, and the shadow of the top-hat and <i>chapeau</i> <i>melon</i>
of man, and of the veils of woman.&nbsp; Besides, the colour of the
face is subject to a thousand injuries and accidents.&nbsp; The popular
face of the Londoner has soon lost its gold, its white, and the delicacy
of its red and brown.&nbsp; We miss little beauty by the fact that it
is never seen freely in great numbers out-of-doors.&nbsp; You get it
in some quantity when all the heads of a great indoor meeting are turned
at once upon a speaker; but it is only in the open air, needless to
say, that the colour of life is in perfection, in the open air, &ldquo;clothed
with the sun,&rdquo; whether the sunshine be golden and direct, or dazzlingly
diffused in grey.</p>
<p>The little figure of the London boy it is that has restored to the
landscape the human colour of life.&nbsp; He is allowed to come out
of all his ignominies, and to take the late colour of the midsummer
north-west evening, on the borders of the Serpentine.&nbsp; At the stroke
of eight he sheds the slough of nameless colours&mdash;all allied to
the hues of dust, soot, and fog, which are the colours the world has
chosen for its boys&mdash;and he makes, in his hundreds, a bright and
delicate flush between the grey-blue water and the grey-blue sky.&nbsp;
Clothed now with the sun, he is crowned by-and-by with twelve stars
as he goes to bathe, and the reflection of an early moon is under his
feet.</p>
<p>So little stands between a gamin and all the dignities of Nature.&nbsp;
They are so quickly restored.&nbsp; There seems to be nothing to do,
but only a little thing to undo.&nbsp; It is like the art of Eleonora
Duse.&nbsp; The last and most finished action of her intellect, passion,
and knowledge is, as it were, the flicking away of some insignificant
thing mistaken for art by other actors, some little obstacle to the
way and liberty of Nature.</p>
<p>All the squalor is gone in a moment, kicked off with the second boot,
and the child goes shouting to complete the landscape with the lacking
colour of life.&nbsp; You are inclined to wonder that, even undressed,
he still shouts with a Cockney accent.&nbsp; You half expect pure vowels
and elastic syllables from his restoration, his spring, his slenderness,
his brightness, and his glow.&nbsp; Old ivory and wild rose in the deepening
midsummer sun, he gives his colours to his world again.</p>
<p>It is easy to replace man, and it will take no great time, where
Nature has lapsed, to replace Nature.&nbsp; It is always to do, by the
happily easy way of doing nothing.&nbsp; The grass is always ready to
grow in the streets&mdash;and no streets could ask for a more charming
finish than your green grass.&nbsp; The gasometer even must fall to
pieces unless it is renewed; but the grass renews itself.&nbsp; There
is nothing so remediable as the work of modern man&mdash;&ldquo;a thought
which is also,&rdquo; as Mr Pecksniff said, &ldquo;very soothing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And by remediable I mean, of course, destructible.&nbsp; As the bathing
child shuffles off his garments&mdash;they are few, and one brace suffices
him&mdash;so the land might always, in reasonable time, shuffle off
its yellow brick and purple slate, and all the things that collect about
railway stations.&nbsp; A single night almost clears the air of London.</p>
<p>But if the colour of life looks so well in the rather sham scenery
of Hyde Park, it looks brilliant and grave indeed on a real sea-coast.&nbsp;
To have once seen it there should be enough to make a colourist.&nbsp;
O memorable little picture!&nbsp; The sun was gaining colour as it neared
setting, and it set not over the sea, but over the land.&nbsp; The sea
had the dark and rather stern, but not cold, blue of that aspect&mdash;the
dark and not the opal tints.&nbsp; The sky was also deep.&nbsp; Everything
was very definite, without mystery, and exceedingly simple.&nbsp; The
most luminous thing was the shining white of an edge of foam, which
did not cease to be white because it was a little golden and a little
rosy in the sunshine.&nbsp; It was still the whitest thing imaginable.&nbsp;
And the next most luminous thing was the little child, also invested
with the sun and the colour of life.</p>
<p>In the case of women, it is of the living and unpublished blood that
the violent world has professed to be delicate and ashamed.&nbsp; See
the curious history of the political rights of woman under the Revolution.&nbsp;
On the scaffold she enjoyed an ungrudged share in the fortunes of party.&nbsp;
Political life might be denied her, but that seems a trifle when you
consider how generously she was permitted political death.&nbsp; She
was to spin and cook for her citizen in the obscurity of her living
hours; but to the hour of her death was granted a part in the largest
interests, social, national, international.&nbsp; The blood wherewith
she should, according to Robespierre, have blushed to be seen or heard
in the tribune, was exposed in the public sight unsheltered by her veins.</p>
<p>Against this there was no modesty.&nbsp; Of all privacies, the last
and the innermost&mdash;the privacy of death&mdash;was never allowed
to put obstacles in the way of public action for a public cause.&nbsp;
Women might be, and were, duly suppressed when, by the mouth of Olympe
de Gouges, they claimed a &ldquo;right to concur in the choice of representatives
for the formation of the laws&rdquo;; but in her person, too, they were
liberally allowed to bear political responsibility to the Republic.&nbsp;
Olympe de Gouges was guillotined.&nbsp; Robespierre thus made her public
and complete amends.</p>
<h2>THE HORIZON</h2>
<p>To mount a hill is to lift with you something lighter and brighter
than yourself or than any meaner burden.&nbsp; You lift the world, you
raise the horizon; you give a signal for the distance to stand up.&nbsp;
It is like the scene in the Vatican when a Cardinal, with his dramatic
Italian hands, bids the kneeling groups to arise.&nbsp; He does more
than bid them.&nbsp; He lifts them, he gathers them up, far and near,
with the upward gesture of both arms; he takes them to their feet with
the compulsion of his expressive force.&nbsp; Or it is as when a conductor
takes his players to successive heights of music.&nbsp; You summon the
sea, you bring the mountains, the distances unfold unlooked-for wings
and take an even flight.&nbsp; You are but a man lifting his weight
upon the upward road, but as you climb the circle of the world goes
up to face you.</p>
<p>Not here or there, but with a definite continuity, the unseen unfolds.&nbsp;
This distant hill outsoars that less distant, but all are on the wing,
and the plain raises its verge.&nbsp; All things follow and wait upon
your eyes.&nbsp; You lift these up, not by the raising of your eyelids,
but by the pilgrimage of your body.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lift thine eyes to
the mountains.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is then that other mountains lift themselves
to your human eyes.</p>
<p>It is the law whereby the eye and the horizon answer one another
that makes the way up a hill so full of universal movement.&nbsp; All
the landscape is on pilgrimage.&nbsp; The town gathers itself closer,
and its inner harbours literally come to light; the headlands repeat
themselves; little cups within the treeless hills open and show their
farms.&nbsp; In the sea are many regions.&nbsp; A breeze is at play
for a mile or two, and the surface is turned.&nbsp; There are roads
and curves in the blue and in the white.&nbsp; Not a step of your journey
up the height that has not its replies in the steady motion of land
and sea.&nbsp; Things rise together like a flock of many-feathered birds.</p>
<p>But it is the horizon, more than all else, you have come in search
of.&nbsp; That is your chief companion on your way.&nbsp; It is to uplift
the horizon to the equality of your sight that you go high.&nbsp; You
give it a distance worthy of the skies.&nbsp; There is no distance,
except the distance in the sky, to be seen from the level earth; but
from the height is to be seen the distance of this world.&nbsp; The
line is sent back into the remoteness of light, the verge is removed
beyond verge, into a distance that is enormous and minute.</p>
<p>So delicate and so slender is the distant horizon that nothing less
near than Queen Mab and her chariot can equal its fineness.&nbsp; Here
on the edges of the eyelids, or there on the edges of the world&mdash;we
know no other place for things so exquisitely made, so thin, so small
and tender.&nbsp; The touches of her passing, as close as dreams, or
the utmost vanishing of the forest or the ocean in the white light between
the earth and the air; nothing else is quite so intimate and fine.&nbsp;
The extremities of a mountain view have just such tiny touches as the
closeness of closed eyes shuts in.</p>
<p>On the horizon is the sweetest light.&nbsp; Elsewhere colour mars
the simplicity of light; but there colour is effaced, not as men efface
it, by a blur or darkness, but by mere light.&nbsp; The bluest sky disappears
on that shining edge; there is not substance enough for colour.&nbsp;
The rim of the hill, of the woodland, of the meadow-land, of the sea&mdash;let
it only be far enough&mdash;has the same absorption of colour; and even
the dark things drawn upon the bright edges of the sky are lucid, the
light is among them, and they are mingled with it.&nbsp; The horizon
has its own way of making bright the pencilled figures of forests, which
are black but luminous.</p>
<p>On the horizon, moreover, closes the long perspective of the sky.&nbsp;
There you perceive that an ordinary sky of clouds&mdash;not a thunder
sky&mdash;is not a wall but the underside of a floor.&nbsp; You see
the clouds that repeat each other grow smaller by distance; and you
find a new unity in the sky and earth that gather alike the great lines
of their designs to the same distant close.&nbsp; There is no longer
an alien sky, tossed up in unintelligible heights above a world that
is subject to intelligible perspective.</p>
<p>Of all the things that London has foregone, the most to be regretted
is the horizon.&nbsp; Not the bark of the trees in its right colour;
not the spirit of the growing grass, which has in some way escaped from
the parks; not the smell of the earth unmingled with the odour of soot;
but rather the mere horizon.&nbsp; No doubt the sun makes a beautiful
thing of the London smoke at times, and in some places of the sky; but
not there, not where the soft sharp distance ought to shine.&nbsp; To
be dull there is to put all relations and comparisons in the wrong,
and to make the sky lawless.</p>
<p>A horizon dark with storm is another thing.&nbsp; The weather darkens
the line and defines it, or mingles it with the raining cloud; or softly
dims it, or blackens it against a gleam of narrow sunshine in the sky.&nbsp;
The stormy horizon will take wing, and the sunny.&nbsp; Go high enough,
and you can raise the light from beyond the shower, and the shadow from
behind the ray.&nbsp; Only the shapeless and lifeless smoke disobeys
and defeats the summer of the eyes.</p>
<p>Up at the top of the seaward hill your first thought is one of some
compassion for sailors, inasmuch as they see but little of their sea.&nbsp;
A child on a mere Channel cliff looks upon spaces and sizes that they
cannot see in the Pacific, on the ocean side of the world.&nbsp; Never
in the solitude of the blue water, never between the Cape of Good Hope
and Cape Horn, never between the Islands and the West, has the seaman
seen anything but a little circle of sea.&nbsp; The Ancient Mariner,
when he was alone, did but drift through a thousand narrow solitudes.&nbsp;
The sailor has nothing but his mast, indeed.&nbsp; And but for his mast
he would be isolated in as small a world as that of a traveller through
the plains.</p>
<p>Round the plains the horizon lies with folded wings.&nbsp; It keeps
them so perpetually for man, and opens them only for the bird, replying
to flight with flight.</p>
<p>A close circlet of waves is the sailor&rsquo;s famous offing.&nbsp;
His offing hardly deserves the name of horizon.&nbsp; To hear him you
might think something of his offing, but you do not so when you sit
down in the centre of it.</p>
<p>As the upspringing of all things at your going up the heights, so
steady, so swift, is the subsidence at your descent.&nbsp; The further
sea lies away, hill folds down behind hill.&nbsp; The whole upstanding
world, with its looks serene and alert, its distant replies, its signals
of many miles, its signs and communications of light, gathers down and
pauses.&nbsp; This flock of birds which is the mobile landscape wheels
and goes to earth.&nbsp; The Cardinal weighs down the audience with
his downward hands.&nbsp; Farewell to the most delicate horizon.</p>
<h2>IN JULY</h2>
<p>One has the leisure of July for perceiving all the differences of
the green of leaves.&nbsp; It is no longer a difference in degrees of
maturity, for all the trees have darkened to their final tone, and stand
in their differences of character and not of mere date.&nbsp; Almost
all the green is grave, not sad and not dull.&nbsp; It has a darkened
and a daily colour, in majestic but not obvious harmony with dark grey
skies, and might look, to inconstant eyes, as prosaic after spring as
eleven o&rsquo;clock looks after the dawn.</p>
<p>Gravity is the word&mdash;not solemnity as towards evening, nor menace
as at night.&nbsp; The daylight trees of July are signs of common beauty,
common freshness, and a mystery familiar and abiding as night and day.&nbsp;
In childhood we all have a more exalted sense of dawn and summer sunrise
than we ever fully retain or quite recover; and also a far higher sensibility
for April and April evenings&mdash;a heartache for them, which in riper
years is gradually and irretrievably consoled.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, childhood has so quickly learned to find
daily things tedious, and familiar things importunate, that it has no
great delight in the mere middle of the day, and feels weariness of
the summer that has ceased to change visibly.&nbsp; The poetry of mere
day and of late summer becomes perceptible to mature eyes that have
long ceased to be sated, have taken leave of weariness, and cannot now
find anything in nature too familiar; eyes which have, indeed, lost
sight of the further awe of midsummer daybreak, and no longer see so
much of the past in April twilight as they saw when they had no past;
but which look freshly at the dailiness of green summer, of early afternoon,
of every sky of any form that comes to pass, and of the darkened elms.</p>
<p>Not unbeloved is this serious tree, the elm, with its leaf sitting
close, unthrilled.&nbsp; Its stature gives it a dark gold head when
it looks alone to a late sun.&nbsp; But if one could go by all the woods,
across all the old forests that are now meadowlands set with trees,
and could walk a county gathering trees of a single kind in the mind,
as one walks a garden collecting flowers of a single kind in the hand,
would not the harvest be a harvest of poplars?&nbsp; A veritable passion
for poplars is a most intelligible passion.&nbsp; The eyes do gather
them, far and near, on a whole day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; Not one is
unperceived, even though great timber should be passed, and hill-sides
dense and deep with trees.&nbsp; The fancy makes a poplar day of it.&nbsp;
Immediately the country looks alive with signals; for the poplars everywhere
reply to the glance.&nbsp; The woods may be all various, but the poplars
are separate.</p>
<p>All their many kinds (and aspens, their kin, must be counted with
them) shake themselves perpetually free of the motionless forest.&nbsp;
It is easy to gather them.&nbsp; Glances sent into the far distance
pay them a flash of recognition of their gentle flashes; and as you
journey you are suddenly aware of them close by.&nbsp; Light and the
breezes are as quick as the eyes of a poplar-lover to find the willing
tree that dances to be seen.</p>
<p>No lurking for them, no reluctance.&nbsp; One could never make for
oneself an oak day so well.&nbsp; The oaks would wait to be found, and
many would be missed from the gathering.&nbsp; But the poplars are alert
enough for a traveller by express; they have an alarum aloft, and do
not sleep.&nbsp; From within some little grove of other trees a single
poplar makes a slight sign; or a long row of poplars suddenly sweep
the wind.&nbsp; They are salient everywhere, and full of replies.&nbsp;
They are as fresh as streams.</p>
<p>It is difficult to realize a drought where there are many poplars.&nbsp;
And yet their green is not rich; the coolest have a colour much mingled
with a cloud-grey.&nbsp; It does but need fresh and simple eyes to recognize
their unfaded life.&nbsp; When the other trees grow dark and keep still,
the poplar and the aspen do not darken&mdash;or hardly&mdash;and the
deepest summer will not find a day in which they do not keep awake.&nbsp;
No waters are so vigilant, even where a lake is bare to the wind.</p>
<p>When Keats said of his Dian that she fastened up her hair &ldquo;with
fingers cool as aspen leaves,&rdquo; he knew the coolest thing in the
world.&nbsp; It is a coolness of colour, as well as of a leaf which
the breeze takes on both sides&mdash;the greenish and the greyish.&nbsp;
The poplar green has no glows, no gold; it is an austere colour, as
little rich as the colour of willows, and less silvery than theirs.&nbsp;
The sun can hardly gild it; but he can shine between.&nbsp; Poplars
and aspens let the sun through with the wind.&nbsp; You may have the
sky sprinkled through them in high midsummer, when all the woods are
close.</p>
<p>Sending your fancy poplar-gathering, then, you ensnare wild trees,
beating with life.&nbsp; No fisher&rsquo;s net ever took such glancing
fishes, nor did the net of a constellation&rsquo;s shape ever enclose
more vibrating Pleiades.</p>
<h2>CLOUD</h2>
<p>During a part of the year London does not see the clouds.&nbsp; Not
to see the clear sky might seem her chief loss, but that is shared by
the rest of England, and is, besides, but a slight privation.&nbsp;
Not to see the clear sky is, elsewhere, to see the cloud.&nbsp; But
not so in London.&nbsp; You may go for a week or two at a time, even
though you hold your head up as you walk, and even though you have windows
that really open, and yet you shall see no cloud, or but a single edge,
the fragment of a form.</p>
<p>Guillotine windows never wholly open, but are filled with a doubled
glass towards the sky when you open them towards the street.&nbsp; They
are, therefore, a sure sign that for all the years when no other windows
were used in London, nobody there cared much for the sky, or even knew
so much as whether there were a sky.</p>
<p>But the privation of cloud is indeed a graver loss than the world
knows.&nbsp; Terrestrial scenery is much, but it is not all.&nbsp; Men
go in search of it; but the celestial scenery journeys to them.&nbsp;
It goes its way round the world.&nbsp; It has no nation, it costs no
weariness, it knows no bonds.&nbsp; The terrestrial scenery&mdash;the
tourist&rsquo;s&mdash;is a prisoner compared with this.&nbsp; The tourist&rsquo;s
scenery moves indeed, but only like Wordsworth&rsquo;s maiden, with
earth&rsquo;s diurnal course; it is made as fast as its own graves.&nbsp;
And for its changes it depends upon the mobility of the skies.&nbsp;
The mere green flushing of its own sap makes only the least of its varieties;
for the greater it must wait upon the visits of the light.&nbsp; Spring
and autumn are inconsiderable events in a landscape compared with the
shadows of a cloud.</p>
<p>The cloud controls the light, and the mountains on earth appear or
fade according to its passage; they wear so simply, from head to foot,
the luminous grey or the emphatic purple, as the cloud permits, that
their own local colour and their own local season are lost and cease,
effaced before the all-important mood of the cloud.</p>
<p>The sea has no mood except that of the sky and of its winds.&nbsp;
It is the cloud that, holding the sun&rsquo;s rays in a sheaf as a giant
holds a handful of spears, strikes the horizon, touches the extreme
edge with a delicate revelation of light, or suddenly puts it out and
makes the foreground shine.</p>
<p>Every one knows the manifest work of the cloud when it descends and
partakes in the landscape obviously, lies half-way across the mountain
slope, stoops to rain heavily upon the lake, and blots out part of the
view by the rough method of standing in front of it.&nbsp; But its greatest
things are done from its own place, aloft.&nbsp; Thence does it distribute
the sun.</p>
<p>Thence does it lock away between the hills and valleys more mysteries
than a poet conceals, but, like him, not by interception.&nbsp; Thence
it writes out and cancels all the tracery of Monte Rosa, or lets the
pencils of the sun renew them.&nbsp; Thence, hiding nothing, and yet
making dark, it sheds deep colour upon the forest land of Sussex, so
that, seen from the hills, all the country is divided between grave
blue and graver sunlight.</p>
<p>And all this is but its influence, its secondary work upon the world.&nbsp;
Its own beauty is unaltered when it has no earthly beauty to improve.&nbsp;
It is always great: above the street, above the suburbs, above the gas-works
and the stucco, above the faces of painted white houses&mdash;the painted
surfaces that have been devised as the only things able to vulgarise
light, as they catch it and reflect it grotesquely from their importunate
gloss.&nbsp; This is to be well seen on a sunny evening in Regent Street.</p>
<p>Even here the cloud is not so victorious as when it towers above
some little landscape of rather paltry interest&mdash;a conventional
river heavy with water, gardens with their little evergreens, walks,
and shrubberies; and thick trees impervious to the light, touched, as
the novelists always have it, with &ldquo;autumn tints.&rdquo;&nbsp;
High over these rises, in the enormous scale of the scenery of clouds,
what no man expected&mdash;an heroic sky.&nbsp; Few of the things that
were ever done upon earth are great enough to be done under such a heaven.&nbsp;
It was surely designed for other days.&nbsp; It is for an epic world.&nbsp;
Your eyes sweep a thousand miles of cloud.&nbsp; What are the distances
of earth to these, and what are the distances of the clear and cloudless
sky?&nbsp; The very horizons of the landscape are near, for the round
world dips so soon; and the distances of the mere clear sky are unmeasured&mdash;you
rest upon nothing until you come to a star, and the star itself is immeasurable.</p>
<p>But in the sky of &ldquo;sunny Alps&rdquo; of clouds the sight goes
farther, with conscious flight, than it could ever have journeyed otherwise.&nbsp;
Man would not have known distance veritably without the clouds.&nbsp;
There are mountains indeed, precipices and deeps, to which those of
the earth are pigmy.&nbsp; Yet the sky-heights, being so far off, are
not overpowering by disproportion, like some futile building fatuously
made too big for the human measure.&nbsp; The cloud in its majestic
place composes with a little Perugino tree.&nbsp; For you stand or stray
in the futile building, while the cloud is no mansion for man, and out
of reach of his limitations.</p>
<p>The cloud, moreover, controls the sun, not merely by keeping the
custody of his rays, but by becoming the counsellor of his temper.&nbsp;
The cloud veils an angry sun, or, more terribly, lets fly an angry ray,
suddenly bright upon tree and tower, with iron-grey storm for a background.&nbsp;
Or when anger had but threatened, the cloud reveals him, gentle beyond
hope.&nbsp; It makes peace, constantly, just before sunset.</p>
<p>It is in the confidence of the winds, and wears their colours.&nbsp;
There is a heavenly game, on south-west wind days, when the clouds are
bowled by a breeze from behind the evening.&nbsp; They are round and
brilliant, and come leaping up from the horizon for hours.&nbsp; This
is a frolic and haphazard sky.</p>
<p>All unlike this is the sky that has a centre, and stands composed
about it.&nbsp; As the clouds marshalled the earthly mountains, so the
clouds in turn are now ranged.&nbsp; The tops of all the celestial Andes
aloft are swept at once by a single ray, warmed with a single colour.&nbsp;
Promontory after league-long promontory of a stiller Mediterranean in
the sky is called out of mist and grey by the same finger.&nbsp; The
cloudland is very great, but a sunbeam makes all its nations and continents
sudden with light.</p>
<p>All this is for the untravelled.&nbsp; All the winds bring him this
scenery.&nbsp; It is only in London, for part of the autumn and part
of the winter, that the unnatural smoke-fog comes between.&nbsp; And
for many and many a day no London eye can see the horizon, or the first
threat of the cloud like a man&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; There never was a
great painter who had not exquisite horizons, and if Corot and Crome
were right, the Londoner loses a great thing.</p>
<p>He loses the coming of the cloud, and when it is high in air he loses
its shape.&nbsp; A cloud-lover is not content to see a snowy and rosy
head piling into the top of the heavens; he wants to see the base and
the altitude.&nbsp; The perspective of a cloud is a great part of its
design&mdash;whether it lies so that you can look along the immense
horizontal distances of its floor, or whether it rears so upright a
pillar that you look up its mountain steeps in the sky as you look at
the rising heights of a mountain that stands, with you, on the earth.</p>
<p>The cloud has a name suggesting darkness; nevertheless, it is not
merely the guardian of the sun&rsquo;s rays and their director.&nbsp;
It is the sun&rsquo;s treasurer; it holds the light that the world has
lost.&nbsp; We talk of sunshine and moonshine, but not of cloud-shine,
which is yet one of the illuminations of our skies.&nbsp; A shining
cloud is one of the most majestic of all secondary lights.&nbsp; If
the reflecting moon is the bride, this is the friend of the bridegroom.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the cloud of a thunderous summer is the most beautiful
of all.&nbsp; It has spaces of a grey for which there is no name, and
no other cloud looks over at a vanishing sun from such heights of blue
air.&nbsp; The shower-cloud, too, with its thin edges, comes across
the sky with so influential a flight that no ship going out to sea can
be better worth watching.&nbsp; The dullest thing perhaps in the London
streets is that people take their rain there without knowing anything
of the cloud that drops it.&nbsp; It is merely rain, and means wetness.&nbsp;
The shower-cloud there has limits of time, but no limits of form, and
no history whatever.&nbsp; It has not come from the clear edge of the
plain to the south, and will not shoulder anon the hill to the north.&nbsp;
The rain, for this city, hardly comes or goes; it does but begin and
stop.&nbsp; No one looks after it on the path of its retreat.</p>
<h2>SHADOWS</h2>
<p>Another good reason that we ought to leave blank, unvexed, and unencumbered
with paper patterns the ceiling and walls of a simple house is that
the plain surface may be visited by the unique designs of shadows.&nbsp;
The opportunity is so fine a thing that it ought oftener to be offered
to the light and to yonder handful of long sedges and rushes in a vase.&nbsp;
Their slender grey design of shadows upon white walls is better than
a tedious, trivial, or anxious device from the shop.</p>
<p>The shadow has all intricacies of perspective simply translated into
line and intersecting curve, and pictorially presented to the eyes,
not to the mind.&nbsp; The shadow knows nothing except its flat designs.&nbsp;
It is single; it draws a decoration that was never seen before, and
will never be seen again, and that, untouched, varies with the journey
of the sun, shifts the interrelation of a score of delicate lines at
the mere passing of time, though all the room be motionless.&nbsp; Why
will design insist upon its importunate immortality?&nbsp; Wiser is
the drama, and wiser the dance, that do not pause upon an attitude.&nbsp;
But these walk with passion or pleasure, while the shadow walks with
the earth.&nbsp; It alters as the hours wheel.</p>
<p>Moreover, while the habit of your sunward thoughts is still flowing
southward, after the winter and the spring, it surprises you in the
sudden gleam of a north-westering sun.&nbsp; It decks a new wall; it
is shed by a late sunset through a window unvisited for a year past;
it betrays the flitting of the sun into unwonted skies&mdash;a sun that
takes the midsummer world in the rear, and shows his head at a sally-porte,
and is about to alight on an unused horizon.&nbsp; So does the grey
drawing, with which you have allowed the sun and your pot of rushes
to adorn your room, play the stealthy game of the year.</p>
<p>You need not stint yourself of shadows, for an occasion.&nbsp; It
needs but four candles to make a hanging Oriental bell play the most
buoyant jugglery overhead.&nbsp; Two lamps make of one palm-branch a
symmetrical countercharge of shadows, and here two palm-branches close
with one another in shadow, their arches flowing together, and their
paler greys darkening.&nbsp; It is hard to believe that there are many
to prefer a &ldquo;repeating pattern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be granted to them that a grey day robs of their decoration
the walls that should be sprinkled with shadows.&nbsp; Let, then, a
plaque or a picture be kept for hanging on shadowless clays.&nbsp; To
dress a room once for all, and to give it no more heed, is to neglect
the units of the days.</p>
<p>Shadows within doors are yet only messages from that world of shadows
which is the landscape of sunshine.&nbsp; Facing a May sun you see little
except an infinite number of shadows.&nbsp; Atoms of shadow&mdash;be
the day bright enough&mdash;compose the very air through which you see
the light.&nbsp; The trees show you a shadow for every leaf, and the
poplars are sprinkled upon the shining sky with little shadows that
look translucent.&nbsp; The liveliness of every shadow is that some
light is reflected into it; shade and shine have been entangled as though
by some wild wind through their million molecules.</p>
<p>The coolness and the dark of night are interlocked with the unclouded
sun.&nbsp; Turn sunward from the north, and shadows come to life, and
are themselves the life, the action, and the transparence of their day.</p>
<p>To eyes tired and retired all day within lowered blinds, the light
looks still and changeless.&nbsp; So many squares of sunshine abide
for so many hours, and when the sun has circled away they pass and are
extinguished.&nbsp; Him who lies alone there the outer world touches
less by this long sunshine than by the haste and passage of a shadow.&nbsp;
Although there may be no tree to stand between his window and the south,
and although no noonday wind may blow a branch of roses across the blind,
shadows and their life will be carried across by a brilliant bird.</p>
<p>To the sick man a cloud-shadow is nothing but an eclipse; he cannot
see its shape, its color, its approach, or its flight.&nbsp; It does
but darken his window as it darkens the day, and is gone again; he does
not see it pluck and snatch the sun.&nbsp; But the flying bird shows
him wings.&nbsp; What flash of light could be more bright for him than
such a flash of darkness?</p>
<p>It is the pulse of life, where all change had seemed to be charmed.&nbsp;
If he had seen the bird itself he would have seen less&mdash;the bird&rsquo;s
shadow was a message from the sun.</p>
<p>There are two separated flights for the fancy to follow, the flight
of the bird in the air, and the flight of its shadow on earth.&nbsp;
This goes across the window blind, across the wood, where it is astray
for a while in the shades; it dips into the valley, growing vaguer and
larger, runs, quicker than the wind, uphill, smaller and darker on the
soft and dry grass, and rushes to meet its bird when the bird swoops
to a branch and clings.</p>
<p>In the great bird country of the north-eastern littoral of England,
about Holy Island and the basaltic rocks, the shadows of the high birds
are the movement and the pulse of the solitude.&nbsp; Where there are
no woods to make a shade, the sun suffers the brilliant eclipse of flocks
of pearl-white sea birds, or of the solitary creature driving on the
wind.&nbsp; Theirs is always a surprise of flight.&nbsp; The clouds
go one way, but the birds go all ways: in from the sea or out, across
the sands, inland to high northern fields, where the crops are late
by a month.&nbsp; They fly so high that though they have the shadow
of the sun under their wings, they have the light of the earth there
also.&nbsp; The waves and the coast shine up to them, and they fly between
lights.</p>
<p>Black flocks and white they gather their delicate shadows up, &ldquo;swift
as dreams,&rdquo; at the end of their flight into the clefts, platforms,
and ledges of harbourless rocks dominating the North Sea.&nbsp; They
subside by degrees, with lessening and shortening volleys of wings and
cries until there comes the general shadow of night wherewith the little
shadows close, complete.</p>
<p>The evening is the shadow of another flight.&nbsp; All the birds
have traced wild and innumerable paths across the mid-May earth; their
shadows have fled all day faster than her streams, and have overtaken
all the movement of her wingless creatures.&nbsp; But now it is the
flight of the very earth that carries her clasped shadow from the sun.</p>
<h2>THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</h2>
<p>All Englishmen know the name of Lucy Hutchinson; and of her calling
and election to the most wifely of all wifehoods&mdash;that of a soldier&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;history has made her countrymen aware.&nbsp; Inasmuch as
Colonel Hutchinson was a political soldier, moreover, she is something
more than his biographer&mdash;his historian.&nbsp; And she convinces
her reader that her Puritan principles kept abreast of her affections.&nbsp;
There is no self-abandonment; she is not precipitate; keeps her own
footing; wife of a soldier as she is, would not have armed him without
her own previous indignation against the enemy.&nbsp; She is a soldier
at his orders, but she had warily and freely chosen her captain.</p>
<p>Briefly, and with the dignity that the language of her day kept unmarred
for her use, she relates her own childhood and youth.&nbsp; She was
a child such as those serious times desired that a child should be;
that is, she was as slightly a child, and for as brief a time, as might
be.&nbsp; Childhood, as an age of progress, was not to be delayed, as
an age of imperfection was to be improved, as an age of inability was
not to be exposed except when precocity distinguished it.&nbsp; It must
at any rate be shortened.&nbsp; Lucy Apsley, at four years old, read
English perfectly, and was &ldquo;carried to sermons, and could remember
and repeat them exactly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At seven she had eight
tutors in several qualities.&rdquo;&nbsp; She outstripped her brothers
in Latin, albeit they were at school and she had no teacher except her
father&rsquo;s chaplain, who, poor gentleman, was &ldquo;a pitiful dull
fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was not companionable.&nbsp; Her many friends
were indulged with &ldquo;babies&rdquo; (that is, dolls) and these she
pulled to pieces.&nbsp; She exhorted the maids, she owned, &ldquo;much.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But she also heard much of their love stories, and acquired a taste
for sonnets.</p>
<p>It was a sonnet, and indeed one of her own writing, that brought
about her acquaintance with Mr. Hutchinson.&nbsp; The sonnet was read
to him, and discussed amongst his friends, with guesses at the authorship;
for a young woman did not, in that world, write a sonnet without a feint
of hiding its origin.&nbsp; One gentleman believed a woman had made
it.&nbsp; Another said, if so, there were but two women capable of making
it; but he owned, later, that he said &ldquo;two&rdquo; out of civility
(very good civility of a kind that is not now practised) to a lady who
chanced to be present; but that he knew well there was but one; and
he named her.&nbsp; From her future husband Lucy Apsley received that
praise of exceptions wherewith women are now, and always will be, praised:
&ldquo;Mr. Hutchinson,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;fancying something of
rationality in the sonnet beyond the customary reach of a she-wit, could
scarcely believe it was a woman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sought her acquaintance, and they were married.&nbsp; Her treasured
conscience did not prevent her from noting the jealousy of her young
friends.&nbsp; A generous mind, perhaps, would rather itself suffer
jealousy than be quick in suspecting, or complacent in causing, or precise
in setting it down.&nbsp; But Mrs. Hutchinson doubtless offered up the
envy of her companions in homage to her Puritan lover&rsquo;s splendour.&nbsp;
His austerity did not hinder him from wearing his &ldquo;fine, thick-set
head of hair&rdquo; in long locks that were an offence to many of his
own sect, but, she says, &ldquo;a great ornament to him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But for herself she has some dissimulated vanities.&nbsp; She was negligent
of dress, and when, after much waiting and many devices, her suitor
first saw her, she was &ldquo;not ugly in a careless riding-habit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As for him, &ldquo;in spite of all her indifference, she was surprised
(she writes) with some unusual liking in her soul when she saw this
gentleman, who had hair, eyes, shape, and countenance enough to beget
love in any one.&rdquo;&nbsp; He married her as soon as she could leave
her chamber, when she was so deformed by small-pox that &ldquo;the priest
and all that saw her were affrighted to look at her; but God recompensed
his justice and constancy by restoring her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following are some of the admirable sentences that prove Lucy
Hutchinson a woman of letters in a far more serious sense than our own
time uses.&nbsp; One phrase has a Stevenson-like character, a kind of
gesture of language; this is where she praises her husband&rsquo;s &ldquo;handsome
management of love.&rdquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>
She thus prefaces her description of her honoured lord: &ldquo;If my
treacherous memory have not lost the dearest treasure that ever I committed
to its trust&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; She boasts of her country in lofty
phrase: &ldquo;God hath, as it were, enclosed a people here, out of
the waste common of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again of her husband:
&ldquo;It will be as hard to say which was the predominant virtue in
him as which is so in its own nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He had made
up his accounts with life and death, and fixed his purpose to entertain
both honourably.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The heat of his youth a little
inclined him to the passion of anger, and the goodness of his nature
to those of love and grief; but reason was never dethroned by them,
but continued governor and moderator of his soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She describes sweetly certain three damsels who had &ldquo;conceived
a kindness&rdquo; for her lord, their susceptibility, their willingness,
their &ldquo;admirable tempting beauty,&rdquo; and &ldquo;such excellent
good-nature as would have thawed a rock of ice&rdquo;; but she adds
no less beautifully, &ldquo;It was not his time to love.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In her widowhood she remembered that she had been commanded &ldquo;not
to grieve at the common rate of women&rdquo;; and this is the lovely
phrase of her grief: &ldquo;As his shadow, she waited on him everywhere,
till he was taken to that region of light which admits of none, and
then she vanished into nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She has an invincible anger against the enemies of her husband and
of the cause.&nbsp; The fevers, &ldquo;little less than plagues,&rdquo;
that were common in that age carry them off exemplarily by families
at a time.&nbsp; An adversary is &ldquo;the devil&rsquo;s exquisite
solicitor.&rdquo;&nbsp; All Royalists are of &ldquo;the wicked faction.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She suspected his warders of poisoning Colonel Hutchinson in the prison
wherein he died.&nbsp; The keeper had given him, under pretence of kindness,
a bottle of excellent wine, and the two gentlemen who drank of it died
within four months.&nbsp; A poison of strange operation!&nbsp; &ldquo;We
must leave it to the great day, when all crimes, how secret soever,
will be made manifest, whether they added poison to all their other
iniquity, whereby they certainly murdered this guiltless servant of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he was near death, she adds, &ldquo;a gentlewoman
of the Castle came up and asked him how he did.&nbsp; He told her, Incomparably
well, and full of faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the subject of politics, Mrs. Hutchinson writes, it must be owned,
platitudes; but all are simple, and some are stated with dignity.&nbsp;
Her power, her integrity, her tenderness, her pomp, the liberal and
public interests of her life, her good breeding, her education, her
exquisite diction, are such as may well make a reader ask how and why
the literature of England declined upon the vulgarity, ignorance, cowardice,
foolishness, that became &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; in the estimation of
a later age; that is, in the character of women succeeding her, and
in the estimation of men succeeding her lord.&nbsp; The noble graces
of Lucy Hutchinson, I say, may well make us marvel at the downfall following&mdash;at
Goldsmith&rsquo;s invention of the women of &ldquo;The Vicar or Wakefield&rdquo;
in one age, and at Thackeray&rsquo;s invention of the women of &ldquo;Esmond&rdquo;
in another.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hutchinson has little leisure for much praise of the natural
beauty of sky and landscape, but now and then in her work there appears
an abiding sense of the pleasantness of the rural world&mdash;in her
day an implicit feeling rather than an explicit.&nbsp; &ldquo;The happiness
of the soil and air contribute all things that are necessary to the
use or delight of man&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He had an opportunity
of conversing with her in those pleasant walks which, at the sweet season
of the spring, invited all the neighbouring inhabitants to seek their
joys.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she describes a dream whereof the scene was in
the green fields of Southwark.&nbsp; What an England was hers!&nbsp;
And what an English!&nbsp; A memorable vintage of our literature and
speech was granted in her day; we owe much to those who&mdash;as she
did&mdash;gathered it in.</p>
<h2>MRS. DINGLEY</h2>
<p>We cannot do her honour by her Christian name. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>&nbsp;
All we have to call her by more tenderly is the mere D, the D that ties
her to Stella, with whom she made the two-in-one whom Swift loved &ldquo;better
a thousand times than life, as hope saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; MD, without
full stops, Swift writes it eight times in a line for the pleasure of
writing it.&nbsp; &ldquo;MD sometimes means Stella alone,&rdquo; says
one of many editors.&nbsp; &ldquo;The letters were written nominally
to Stella and Mrs. Dingley,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;but it does
not require to be said that it was really for Stella&rsquo;s sake alone
that they were penned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; &ldquo;MD&rdquo; never
stands for Stella alone.&nbsp; And the editor does not yet live who
shall persuade one honest reader, against the word of Swift, that Swift
loved Stella only, with an ordinary love, and not, by a most delicate
exception, Stella and Dingley, so joined that they make the &ldquo;she&rdquo;
and &ldquo;her&rdquo; of every letter.&nbsp; And this shall be a paper
of reparation to Mrs. Dingley.</p>
<p>No one else in literary history has been so defrauded of her honours.&nbsp;
In love &ldquo;to divide is not to take away,&rdquo; as Shelley says;
and Dingley&rsquo;s half of the tender things said to MD is equal to
any whole, and takes nothing from the whole of Stella&rsquo;s half.&nbsp;
But the sentimentalist has fought against Mrs. Dingley from the outset.&nbsp;
He has disliked her, shirked her, misconceived her, and effaced her.&nbsp;
Sly sentimentalist&mdash;he finds her irksome.&nbsp; Through one of
his most modern representatives he has but lately called her a &ldquo;chaperon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A chaperon!</p>
<p>MD was not a sentimentalist.&nbsp; Stella was not so, though she
has been pressed into that character; D certainly was not, and has in
this respect been spared by the chronicler; and MD together were &ldquo;saucy
charming MD,&rdquo; &ldquo;saucy little, pretty, dear rogues,&rdquo;
&ldquo;little monkeys mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;little mischievous girls,&rdquo;
&ldquo;nautinautinautidear girls,&rdquo; &ldquo;brats,&rdquo; &ldquo;huzzies
both,&rdquo; &ldquo;impudence and saucy-face,&rdquo; &ldquo;saucy noses,&rdquo;
&ldquo;my dearest lives and delights,&rdquo; &ldquo;dear little young
women,&rdquo; &ldquo;good dallars, not crying dallars&rdquo; (which
means &ldquo;girls&rdquo;), &ldquo;ten thousand times dearest MD,&rdquo;
and so forth in a hundred repetitions.&nbsp; They are, every now and
then, &ldquo;poor MD,&rdquo; but obviously not because of their own
complaining.&nbsp; Swift called them so because they were mortal; and
he, like all great souls, lived and loved, conscious every day of the
price, which is death.</p>
<p>The two were joined by love, not without solemnity, though man, with
his summary and wholesale ready-made sentiment, has thus obstinately
put them asunder.&nbsp; No wholesale sentiment can do otherwise than
foolishly play havoc with such a relation.&nbsp; To Swift it was the
most secluded thing in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am weary of friends,
and friendships are all monsters, except MD&rsquo;s;&rdquo; &ldquo;I
ought to read these letters I write after I have done.&nbsp; But I hope
it does not puzzle little Dingley to read, for I think I mend: but methinks,&rdquo;
he adds, &ldquo;when I write plain, I do not know how, but we are not
alone, all the world can see us.&nbsp; A bad scrawl is so snug; it looks
like PMD.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again: &ldquo;I do not like women so much as
I did.&nbsp; MD, you must know, are not women.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;God
Almighty preserve you both and make us happy together.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I say Amen with all my heart and vitals, that we may never be
asunder ten days together while poor Presto lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Farewell,
dearest beloved MD, and love poor, poor Presto, who has not had one
happy day since he left you, as hope saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With them&mdash;with her&mdash;he hid himself in the world, at Court,
at the bar of St. James&rsquo;s coffee-house, whither he went on the
Irish mail-day, and was &ldquo;in pain except he saw MD&rsquo;s little
handwriting.&rdquo;&nbsp; He hid with them in the long labours of these
exquisite letters every night and morning.&nbsp; If no letter came,
he comforted himself with thinking that &ldquo;he had it yet to be happy
with.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the world has agreed to hide under its own manifold
and lachrymose blunders the grace and singularity&mdash;the distinction&mdash;of
this sweet romance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Little, sequestered pleasure-house&rdquo;&mdash;it
seemed as though &ldquo;the many could not miss it,&rdquo; but not even
the few have found it.</p>
<p>It is part of the scheme of the sympathetic historian that Stella
should be the victim of hope deferred, watching for letters from Swift.&nbsp;
But day and night Presto complains of the scantiness of MD&rsquo;s little
letters; he waits upon &ldquo;her&rdquo; will: &ldquo;I shall make a
sort of journal, and when it is full I will send it whether MD writes
or not; and so that will be pretty.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Naughty girls
that will not write to a body!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you were whipped
for forgetting to send.&nbsp; Go, be far enough, negligent baggages.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You, Mistress Stella, shall write your share, and then comes
Dingley altogether, and then Stella a little crumb at the end; and then
conclude with something handsome and genteel, as &lsquo;your most humble
cumdumble.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; But Scott and Macaulay and Thackeray
are all exceedingly sorry for Stella.</p>
<p>Swift is most charming when he is feigning to complain of his task:
&ldquo;Here is such a stir and bustle with this little MD of ours; I
must be writing every night; O Lord, O Lord!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I must
go write idle things, and twittle twattle.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;These
saucy jades take up so much of my time with writing to them in the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Is it not a stealthy wrong done upon Mrs. Dingley that she should be
stripped of all these ornaments to her name and memory?&nbsp; When Swift
tells a woman in a letter that there he is &ldquo;writing in bed, like
a tiger,&rdquo; she should go gay in the eyes of all generations.</p>
<p>They will not let Stella go gay, because of sentiment; and they will
not let Mrs. Dingley go gay, because of sentiment for Stella.&nbsp;
Marry come up!&nbsp; Why did not the historians assign all the tender
passages (taken very seriously) to Stella, and let Dingley have the
jokes, then?&nbsp; That would have been no ill share for Dingley.&nbsp;
But no, forsooth, Dingley is allowed nothing.</p>
<p>There are passages, nevertheless, which can hardly be taken from
her.&nbsp; For now and then Swift parts his dear MD.&nbsp; When he does
so he invariably drops those initials and writes &ldquo;Stella&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Ppt&rdquo; for the one, and &ldquo;D&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dingley&rdquo;
for the other.&nbsp; There is no exception to this anywhere.&nbsp; He
is anxious about Stella&rsquo;s &ldquo;little eyes,&rdquo; and about
her health generally; whereas Dingley is strong.&nbsp; Poor Ppt, he
thinks, will not catch the &ldquo;new fever,&rdquo; because she is not
well; &ldquo;but why should D escape it, pray?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs.
Dingley is rebuked for her tale of a journey from Dublin to Wexford.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I doubt, Madam Dingley, you are apt to lie in your travels, though
not so bad as Stella; she tells thumpers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stella is often
reproved for her spelling, and Mrs. Dingley writes much the better hand.&nbsp;
But she is a puzzle-headed woman, like another.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do
you mean by my fourth letter, Madam Dinglibus?&nbsp; Does not Stella
say you had my fifth, goody Blunder?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Mistress
Dingley, are you not an impudent slut to except a letter next packet?&nbsp;
Unreasonable baggage!&nbsp; No, little Dingley, I am always in bed by
twelve, and I take great care of myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
a pretending slut, indeed, with your &lsquo;fourth&rsquo; and &lsquo;fifth&rsquo;
in the margin, and your &lsquo;journal&rsquo; and everything.&nbsp;
O Lord, never saw the like, we shall never have done.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never saw such a letter, so saucy, so journalish, so everything.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Swift is insistently grateful for their inquiries for his health.&nbsp;
He pauses seriously to thank them in the midst of his prattle.&nbsp;
Both women&mdash;MD&mdash;are rallied on their politics: &ldquo;I have
a fancy that Ppt is a Tory, I fancy she looks like one, and D a sort
of trimmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it is for Dingley separately that Swift endured a wild bird in
his lodgings.&nbsp; His man Patrick had got one to take over to her
in Ireland.&nbsp; &ldquo;He keeps it in a closet, where it makes a terrible
litter; but I say nothing; I am as tame as a clout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgotten Dingley, happy in this, has not had to endure the ignominy,
in a hundred essays, to be retrospectively offered to Swift as an unclaimed
wife; so far so good.&nbsp; But two hundred years is long for her to
have gone stripped of so radiant a glory as is hers by right.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Better, thanks to MD&rsquo;s prayers,&rdquo; wrote the immortal
man who loved her, in a private fragment of a journal, never meant for
Dingley&rsquo;s eyes, nor for Ppt&rsquo;s, nor for any human eyes; and
the rogue Stella has for two centuries stolen all the credit of those
prayers, and all the thanks of that pious benediction.</p>
<h2>PRUE</h2>
<p>Through the long history of human relations, which is the history
of the life of our race, there sounds at intervals the clamour of a
single voice which has not the tone of oratory, but asks, answers, interrupts
itself, interrupts&mdash;what else?&nbsp; Whatever else it interrupts
is silence; there are pauses, but no answers.&nbsp; There is the jest
without the laugh, and again the laugh without the jest.&nbsp; And this
is because the letters written by Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; were
all saved, and not many written to her; because Swift burnt the letters
that were the dearest things in life to him, while &ldquo;MD&rdquo;
both made a treasury of his; and because Prue kept all the letters which
Steele wrote to her from their marriage-day onwards, and Steele kept
none of hers.</p>
<p>In Swift&rsquo;s case the silence is full of echoes; that is to say,
his letters repeat the phrases of Stella&rsquo;s and Dingley&rsquo;s,
to play with them, flout them, and toss them back against the two silenced
voices.&nbsp; He never lets the word of these two women fall to the
ground; and when they have but blundered with it, and aimed it wide,
and sent it weakly, he will catch it, and play you twenty delicate and
expert juggling pranks with it as he sends it back into their innocent
faces.&nbsp; So we have something of MD&rsquo;s letters in the &ldquo;journal,&rdquo;
and this in the only form in which we desire them, to tell the truth;
for when Swift gravely saves us some specimens of Stella&rsquo;s wit,
after her death, as she spoke them, and not as he mimicked them, they
make a sorry show.</p>
<p>In many correspondences, where one voice remains and the other is
gone, the retort is enough for two.&nbsp; It is as when, the other day,
the half of a pretty quarrel between nurse and child came down from
an upper floor to the ears of a mother who decided that she need not
interfere.&nbsp; The voice of the undaunted child it was that was audible
alone, and it replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not; <i>you</i> are&rdquo;;
and anon, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell <i>yours</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing
was really missing there.</p>
<p>But Steele&rsquo;s letters to Prue, his wife, are no such simple
matter.&nbsp; The turn we shall give them depends upon the unheard tone
whereto they reply.&nbsp; And there is room for conjecture.&nbsp; It
has pleased the more modern of the many spirits of banter to supply
Prue&rsquo;s eternal silence with the voice of a scold.&nbsp; It is
painful to me to complain of Thackeray; but see what a figure he makes
of Prue in &ldquo;Esmond.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is, says the nineteenth-century
humourist, in defence against the pursuit of a jealous, exacting, neglected,
or evaded wife that poor Dick Steele sends those little notes of excuse:
&ldquo;Dearest Being on earth, pardon me if you do not see me till eleven
o&rsquo;clock, having met a schoolfellow from India&rdquo;; &ldquo;My
dear, dear wife, I write to let you know I do not come home to dinner,
being obliged to attend some business abroad, of which I shall give
you an account (when I see you in the evening), as becomes your dutiful
and obedient husband&rdquo;; &ldquo;Dear Prue, I cannot come home to
dinner.&nbsp; I languish for your welfare&rdquo;; &ldquo;I stay here
in order to get Tonson to discount a bill for me, and shall dine with
him to that end&rdquo;; and so forth.&nbsp; Once only does Steele really
afford the recent humourist the suggestion that is apparently always
so welcome.&nbsp; It is when he writes that he is invited to supper
to Mr. Boyle&rsquo;s, and adds: &ldquo;Dear Prue, do not send after
me, for I shall be ridiculous.&rdquo;&nbsp; But even this is to be read
not ungracefully by a well-graced reader.&nbsp; Prue was young and unused
to the world.&nbsp; Her husband, by the way, had been already married;
and his greater age makes his constant deference all the more charming.</p>
<p>But with this one exception, Steele&rsquo;s little notes, kept by
his wife while she lived, and treasured after her death by her daughter
and his, are no record of the watchings and dodgings of a London farce.&nbsp;
It is worth while to remember that Steele&rsquo;s dinner, which it was
so often difficult to eat at home, was a thing of midday, and therefore
of mid-business.&nbsp; But that is a detail.&nbsp; What is desirable
is that a reasonable degree of sweetness should be attributed to Prue;
for it is no more than just.&nbsp; To her Steele wrote in a dedication:
&ldquo;How often has your tenderness removed pain from my aching head,
how often anguish from my afflicted heart.&nbsp; If there are such beings
as guardian angels, they are thus employed.&nbsp; I cannot believe one
of them to be more good in inclination, or more charming in form, than
my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True, this was for the public; but not so were these daily notes;
and these carry to her his assurance that she is &ldquo;the beautifullest
object in the world.&nbsp; I know no happiness in this life in any degree
comparable to the pleasure I have in your person and society.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But indeed, though you have every perfection, you have an extravagant
fault, which almost frustrates the good in you to me; and that is, that
you do not love to dress, to appear, to shine out, even at my request,
and to make me proud of you, or rather to indulge the pride I have that
you are mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The correction of the phrase is finely considerate.</p>
<p>Prue cannot have been a dull wife, for this last compliment is a
reply, full of polite alacrity, to a letter from her asking for a little
flattery.&nbsp; How assiduously, and with what a civilized absence of
uncouthness, of shame-facedness, and of slang of the mind, with what
simplicity, alertness, and finish, does he step out at her invitation,
and perform!&nbsp; She wanted a compliment, though they had been long
married then, and he immediately turned it.&nbsp; This was no dowdy
Prue.</p>
<p>Her request, by the way, which he repeats in obeying it, is one of
the few instances of the other side of the correspondence&mdash;one
of the few direct echoes of that one of the two voices which is silent.</p>
<p>The ceremony of the letters and the deferent method of address and
signature are never dropped in this most intimate of letter-writing.&nbsp;
It is not a little depressing to think that in this very form and state
is supposed, by the modern reader, to lurk the stealthiness of the husband
of farce, the &ldquo;rogue.&rdquo;&nbsp; One does not like the word.&nbsp;
Is it not clownish to apply it with intention to the husband of Prue?&nbsp;
He did not pay, he was always in difficulties, he hid from bailiffs,
he did many other things that tarnish honour, more or less, and things
for which he had to beg Prue&rsquo;s special pardon; but yet he is not
a fit subject for the unhandsome incredulity which is proud to be always
at hand with an ironic commentary on such letters as his.</p>
<p>I have no wish to bowdlerize Sir Richard Steele, his ways and words.&nbsp;
He wrote to Prue at night when the burgundy had been too much for him,
and in the morning after.&nbsp; He announces that he is coming to her
&ldquo;within a pint of wine.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of his gayest letters&mdash;a
love-letter before the marriage, addressed to &ldquo;dear lovely Mrs.
Scurlock&rdquo;&mdash;confesses candidly that he had been pledging her
too well: &ldquo;I have been in very good company, where your health,
under the character of the woman I loved best, has been often drunk;
so that I may say that I am dead drunk for your sake, which is more
than <i>I</i> <i>die</i> <i>for</i> <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele obviously drank burgundy wildly, as did his &ldquo;good company&rdquo;;
as did also the admirable Addison, who was so solitary in character
and so serene in temperament.&nbsp; But no one has, for this fault,
the right to put a railing accusation into the mouth of Prue.&nbsp;
Every woman has a right to her own silence, whether her silence be hers
of set purpose or by accident.&nbsp; And every creature has a right
to security from the banterings peculiar to the humourists of a succeeding
age.&nbsp; To every century its own ironies, to every century its own
vulgarities.&nbsp; In Steele&rsquo;s time they had theirs.&nbsp; They
might have rallied Prue more coarsely, but it would have been with a
different rallying.&nbsp; Writers of the nineteenth century went about
to rob her of her grace.</p>
<p>She kept some four hundred of these little letters of her lord&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
It was a loyal keeping.&nbsp; But what does Thackeray call it?&nbsp;&nbsp;
His word is &ldquo;thrifty.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;There are four
hundred letters of Dick Steele&rsquo;s to his wife, which that thrifty
woman preserved accurately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrifty&rdquo; is a hard word to apply to her whom Steele
styled, in the year before her death, his &ldquo;charming little insolent.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She was ill in Wales, and he, at home, wept upon her pillow, and &ldquo;took
it to be a sin to go to sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thrifty they may call her,
and accurate if they will; but she lies in Westminster Abbey, and Steele
called her &ldquo;your Prueship.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>MRS. JOHNSON</h2>
<p>This paper shall not be headed &ldquo;Tetty.&rdquo;&nbsp; What may
be a graceful enough freedom with the wives of other men shall be prohibited
in the case of Johnson&rsquo;s, she with whose name no writer until
now has scrupled to take freedoms whereto all graces were lacking.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tetty&rdquo; it should not be, if for no other reason, for this&mdash;that
the chance of writing &ldquo;Tetty&rdquo; as a title is a kind of facile
literary opportunity; it shall be denied.&nbsp; The Essay owes thus
much amends of deliberate care to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; But,
indeed, the reason is graver.&nbsp; What wish would he have had but
that the language in the making whereof he took no ignoble part should
somewhere, at some time, treat his only friend with ordinary honour?</p>
<p>Men who would trust Dr. Johnson with their orthodoxy, with their
vocabulary, and with the most intimate vanity of their human wishes,
refuse, with every mark of insolence, to trust him in regard to his
wife.&nbsp; On that one point no reverence is paid to him, no deference,
no respect, not so much as the credit due to our common sanity.&nbsp;
Yet he is not reviled on account of his Thrale&mdash;nor, indeed, is
his Thrale now seriously reproached for her Piozzi.&nbsp; It is true
that Macaulay, preparing himself and his reader &ldquo;in his well-known
way&rdquo; (as a rustic of Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s might have it) for the
recital of her second marriage, says that it would have been well if
she had been laid beside the kind and generous Thrale when, in the prime
of her life, he died.&nbsp; But Macaulay has not left us heirs to his
indignation.&nbsp; His well-known way was to exhaust those possibilities
of effect in which the commonplace is so rich.&nbsp; And he was permitted
to point his paragraphs as he would, not only by calling Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s
attachment to her second husband &ldquo;a degrading passion,&rdquo;
but by summoning a chorus of &ldquo;all London&rdquo; to the same purpose.&nbsp;
She fled, he tells us, from the laughter and hisses of her countrymen
and countrywomen to a land where she was unknown.&nbsp; Thus when Macaulay
chastises Mrs. Elizabeth Porter for marrying Johnson, he is not inconsistent,
for he pursues Mrs. Thrale with equal rigour for her audacity in keeping
gaiety and grace in her mind and manners longer than Macaulay liked
to see such ornaments added to the charm of twice &ldquo;married brows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not so with succeeding essayists.&nbsp; One of these minor
biographers is so gentle as to call the attachment of Mrs. Thrale and
Piozzi &ldquo;a mutual affection.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds, &ldquo;No one
who has had some experience of life will be inclined to condemn Mrs.
Thrale.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there is no such courtesy, even from him, for
Mrs. Johnson.&nbsp; Neither to him nor to any other writer has it yet
occurred that if England loves her great Englishman&rsquo;s memory,
she owes not only courtesy, but gratitude, to the only woman who loved
him while there was yet time.</p>
<p>Not a thought of that debt has stayed the alacrity with which a caricature
has been acclaimed as the only possible portrait of Mrs. Johnson.&nbsp;
Garrick&rsquo;s school reminiscences would probably have made a much
more charming woman grotesque.&nbsp; Garrick is welcome to his remembrances;
we may even reserve for ourselves the liberty of envying those who heard
him.&nbsp; But honest laughter should not fall into that tone of common
antithesis which seems to say, &ldquo;See what are the absurdities of
the great!&nbsp; Such is life!&nbsp; On this one point we, even we,
are wiser than Dr. Johnson&mdash;we know how grotesque was his wife.&nbsp;
We know something of the privacies of her toilet-table.&nbsp; We are
able to compare her figure with the figures we, unlike him in his youth,
have had the opportunity of admiring&mdash;the figures of the well-bred
and well-dressed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a sorry success to be able to say
so much.</p>
<p>But in fact such a triumph belongs to no man.&nbsp; When Samuel Johnson,
at twenty-six, married his wife, he gave the dull an advantage over
himself which none but the dullest will take.&nbsp; He chose, for love,
a woman who had the wit to admire him at first meeting, and in spite
of first sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said to her daughter,
&ldquo;is the most sensible man I ever met.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was penniless.&nbsp;
She had what was no mean portion for those times and those conditions;
and, granted that she was affected, and provincial, and short, and all
the rest with which she is charged, she was probably not without suitors;
nor do her defects or faults seem to have been those of an unadmired
or neglected woman.&nbsp; Next, let us remember what was the aspect
of Johnson&rsquo;s form and face, even in his twenties, and how little
he could have touched the senses of a widow fond of externals.&nbsp;
This one loved him, accepted him, made him happy, gave to one of the
noblest of all English hearts the one love of its sombre life.&nbsp;
And English literature has had no better phrase for her than Macaulay&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;She
accepted, with a readiness which did her little honour, the addresses
of a suitor who might have been her son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her readiness did her incalculable honour.&nbsp; But it is at last
worth remembering that Johnson had first done her incalculable honour.&nbsp;
No one has given to man or woman the right to judge as to the worthiness
of her who received it.&nbsp; The meanest man is generally allowed his
own counsel as to his own wife; one of the greatest of men has been
denied it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The lover,&rdquo; says Macaulay, &ldquo;continued
to be under the illusions of the wedding day till the lady died.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What is so graciously said is not enough.&nbsp; He was under those &ldquo;illusions&rdquo;
until he too died, when he had long passed her latest age, and was therefore
able to set right that balance of years which has so much irritated
the impertinent.&nbsp; Johnson passed from this life twelve years older
than she, and so for twelve years his constant eyes had to turn backwards
to dwell upon her.&nbsp; Time gave him a younger wife.</p>
<p>And here I will put into Mrs. Johnson&rsquo;s mouth, that mouth to
which no one else has ever attributed any beautiful sayings, the words
of Marceline Desbordes-Valmore to the young husband she loved: &ldquo;Older
than thou!&nbsp; Let me never see thou knowest it.&nbsp; Forget it!&nbsp;
I will remember it, to die before thy death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macaulay, in his unerring effectiveness, uses Johnson&rsquo;s short
sight for an added affront to Mrs. Johnson.&nbsp; The bridegroom was
too weak of eyesight &ldquo;to distinguish ceruse from natural bloom.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nevertheless, he saw well enough, when he was old, to distinguish Mrs.
Thrale&rsquo;s dresses.&nbsp; He reproved her for wearing a dark dress;
it was unsuitable, he said, for her size; a little creature should show
gay colours &ldquo;like an insect.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are not called upon
to admire his wife; why, then, our taste being thus uncompromised, do
we not suffer him to admire her?&nbsp; It is the most gratuitous kind
of intrusion.&nbsp; Moreover, the biographers are eager to permit that
touch of romance and grace in his relations to Mrs. Thrale, which they
officially deny in the case of Mrs. Johnson.&nbsp; But the difference
is all on the other side.&nbsp; He would not have bidden his wife dress
like an insect.&nbsp; Mrs. Thrale was to him &ldquo;the first of womankind&rdquo;
only because his wife was dead.</p>
<p>Beauclerc, we learn, was wont to cap Garrick&rsquo;s mimicry of Johnson&rsquo;s
love-making by repeating the words of Johnson himself in after-years&mdash;&ldquo;It
was a love-match on both sides.&rdquo;&nbsp; And obviously he was as
strange a lover as they said.&nbsp; Who doubted it?&nbsp; Was there
any other woman in England to give such a suitor the opportunity of
an eternal love?&nbsp; &ldquo;A life radically wretched,&rdquo; was
the life of this master of Letters; but she, who has received nothing
in return except ignominy from these unthankful Letters, had been alone
to make it otherwise.&nbsp; Well for him that he married so young as
to earn the ridicule of all the biographers in England; for by doing
so he, most happily, possessed his wife for nearly twenty years.&nbsp;
I have called her his only friend.&nbsp; So indeed she was, though he
had followers, disciples, rivals, competitors, and companions, many
degrees of admirers, a biographer, a patron, and a public.&nbsp; He
had also the houseful of sad old women who quarrelled under his beneficent
protection.&nbsp; But what friend had he?&nbsp; He was &ldquo;solitary&rdquo;
from the day she died.</p>
<p>Let us consider under what solemn conditions and in what immortal
phrase the word &ldquo;solitary&rdquo; stands.&nbsp; He wrote it, all
Englishmen know where.&nbsp; He wrote it in the hour of that melancholy
triumph when he had been at last set free from the dependence upon hope.&nbsp;
He hoped no more, and he needed not to hope.&nbsp; The &ldquo;notice&rdquo;
of Lord Chesterfield had been too long deferred; it was granted at last,
when it was a flattery which Johnson&rsquo;s court of friends would
applaud.&nbsp; But not for their sake was it welcome.&nbsp; To no living
ear would he bring it and report it with delight.</p>
<p>He was indifferent, he was known.&nbsp; The sensitiveness to pleasure
was gone, and the sensitiveness to pain, slights, and neglect would
thenceforth be suffered to rest; no man in England would put that to
proof again.&nbsp; No man in England, did I say?&nbsp; But, indeed,
that is not so.&nbsp; No slight to him, to his person, or to his fame
could have had power to cause him pain more sensibly than the customary,
habitual, ready-made ridicule that has been cast by posterity upon her
whom he loved for twenty years, prayed for during thirty-two years more,
who satisfied one of the saddest human hearts, but to whom the world,
assiduous to admire him, hardly accords human dignity.&nbsp; He wrote
praises of her manners and of her person for her tomb.&nbsp; But her
epitaph, that does not name her, is in the greatest of English prose.&nbsp;
What was favour to him?&nbsp; &ldquo;I am indifferent . . . I am known
. . . I am solitary, and cannot impart it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>MADAME ROLAND</h2>
<p>The articulate heroine has her reward of appreciation and her dues
of praise; it is her appropriate fortune to have it definitely measured,
and generally on equal terms.&nbsp; She takes pains to explain herself,
and is understood, and pitied, when need is, on the right occasions.&nbsp;
For instance, Madame Roland, a woman of merit, who knew her &ldquo;merit&rsquo;s
name and place,&rdquo; addressed her memoirs, her studies in contemporary
history, her autobiography, her many speeches, and her last phrase at
the foot of the undaunting scaffold, to a great audience of her equals
(more or less) then living and to live in the ages then to come&mdash;her
equals and those she raises to her own level, as the heroic example
has authority to do.</p>
<p>Another woman&mdash;the Queen&mdash;suffered at that time, and suffered
without the command of language, the exactitude of phrase, the precision
of judgement, the proffer of prophecy, the explicit sense of Innocence
and Moderation oppressed in her person.&nbsp; These were Madame Roland&rsquo;s;
but the other woman, without eloquence, without literature, and without
any judicial sense of history, addresses no mere congregation of readers.&nbsp;
Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s unrecorded pangs pass into the treasuries of
the experience of the whole human family.&nbsp; All that are human have
some part there; genius itself may lean in contemplation over that abyss
of woe; the great poets themselves may look into its distances and solitudes.&nbsp;
Compassion here has no measure and no language.&nbsp; Madame Roland
speaks neither to genius nor to complete simplicity; Marie Antoinette
holds her peace in the presence of each, dumb in her presence.</p>
<p>Madame Roland had no dumbness of the spirit, as history, prompted
by her own musical voice, presents her to a world well prepared to do
her justice.&nbsp; Of that justice she had full expectation; justice
here, justice in the world&mdash;the world that even when universal
philosophy should reign would be inevitably the world of mediocrity;
justice that would come of enlightened views; justice that would be
the lesson learnt by the nations widely educated up to some point generally
accessible; justice well within earthly sight and competence.&nbsp;
This confidence was also her reward.&nbsp; For what justice did the
Queen look?&nbsp; Here it is the &ldquo;abyss that appeals to the abyss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twice only in the life of Madame Roland is there a lapse into silence,
and for the record of these two poor failures of that long, indomitable,
reasonable, temperate, explicit utterance which expressed her life and
mind we are debtors to her friends.&nbsp; She herself has not confessed
them.&nbsp; Nowhere else, whether in her candid history of herself,
or in her wise history of her country, or in her judicial history of
her contemporaries, whose spirit she discerned, whose powers she appraised,
whose errors she foresaw; hardly in her thought, and never in her word,
is a break to be perceived; she is not silent and she hardly stammers;
and when she tells us of her tears&mdash;the tears of youth only&mdash;her
record is voluble and all complete.&nbsp; For the dignity of her style,
of her force, and of her balanced character, Madame Roland would doubtless
have effaced the two imperfections which, to us who would be glad to
admire in silence her heroic figure, if that heroic figure would but
cease to talk, are finer and more noble than her well-placed language
and the high successes of her decision and her endurance.&nbsp; More
than this, the two failures of this unfailing woman are two little doors
opened suddenly into those wider spaces and into that dominion of solitude
which, after all, do doubtless exist even in the most garrulous soul.&nbsp;
By these two outlets Manon Roland also reaches the region of Marie Antoinette.&nbsp;
But they befell her at the close of her life, and they shall be named
at the end of this brief study.</p>
<p>Madame Roland may seem the more heroic to those whose suffrages she
seeks in all times and nations because of the fact that she manifestly
suppresses in her self-descriptions any signs of a natural gaiety.&nbsp;
Her memoirs give evidence of no such thing; it is only in her letters,
not intended for the world, that we are aware of the inadvertence of
moments.&nbsp; We may overhear a laugh at times, but not in those consciously
sprightly hours that she spent with her convent-school friend gathering
fruit and counting eggs at the farm.&nbsp; She pursued these country
tasks not without offering herself the cultivated congratulation of
one whom cities had failed to allure, and who bore in mind the examples
of Antiquity.&nbsp; She did not forget the death of Socrates.&nbsp;
Or, rather, she finds an occasion to reproach herself with having once
forgotten it, and with having omitted what another might have considered
the tedious recollection of the condemnation of Phocion.&nbsp; She never
wearied of these examples.&nbsp; But it is her inexhaustible freshness
in these things that has helped other writers of her time to weary us.</p>
<p>In her manner of telling her story there is an absence of all exaggeration,
which gives the reader a constant sense of security.&nbsp; That virtue
of style and thought was one she proposed to herself and attained with
exact consciousness of success.&nbsp; It would be almost enough (in
the perfection of her practice) to make a great writer; even a measure
of it goes far to make a fair one.&nbsp; Her moderation of statement
is never shaken; and if she now and then glances aside from her direct
narrative road to hazard a conjecture, the error she may make is on
the generous side of hope and faith.&nbsp; For instance, she is too
sure that her Friends (so she always calls the <i>Girondins</i>, using
no nicknames) are safe, whereas they were then all doomed; a young man
who had carried a harmless message for her&mdash;a mere notification
to her family of her arrest&mdash;receives her cheerful commendation
for his good feeling; from a note we learn that for this action he suffered
on the scaffold and that his father soon thereafter died of grief.&nbsp;
But Madame Roland never matched such a delirious event as this by any
delirium of her own imagination.&nbsp; The delirium was in things and
in the acts of men; her mind was never hurried from its sane self-possession,
when the facts raved.</p>
<p>It was only when she used the rhetoric ready to her hand that she
stooped to verbal violence; <i>et</i> <i>encore</i>!&nbsp; References
to the banishment of Aristides and the hemlock of Socrates had become
toy daggers and bending swords in the hands of her compatriots, and
she is hardly to be accused of violence in brandishing those weapons.&nbsp;
Sometimes, refuse rhetoric being all too ready, she takes it on her
pen, in honest haste, as though it were honest speech, and stands committed
to such a phrase as this: &ldquo;The dregs of the nation placed such
a one at the helm of affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her manner was not generally to write anything but a clear and
efficient French language.&nbsp; She never wrote for the love of art,
but without some measure of art she did not write; and her simplicity
is somewhat altered by that importunate love of the Antique.&nbsp; In
&ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; there is an old lady who insisted that the
name &ldquo;Mr. Turveydrop,&rdquo; as it appeared polished on the door-plate
of the dancing master, was the name of the pretentious father and not
of the industrious son&mdash;albeit, needless to say, one name was common
to them.&nbsp; With equal severity I aver that when Madame Roland wrote
to her husband in the second person singular she was using the <i>tu</i>
of Rome and not the <i>tu</i> of Paris.&nbsp; French was indeed the
language; but had it been French in spirit she would (in spite of the
growing Republican fashion) have said <i>vous</i> to this &ldquo;homme
&eacute;clair&eacute;, de moeurs pures, &agrave; qui l&rsquo;on ne peut
reprocher que sa grande admiration pour les anciens aux d&eacute;pens
des modernes qu&rsquo;il m&eacute;prise, et le faible de trop aimer
&agrave; parler de lui.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no French <i>tu</i> in
her relations with this husband, gravely esteemed and appraised, discreetly
rebuked, the best passages of whose Ministerial reports she wrote, and
whom she observed as he slowly began to think he himself had composed
them.&nbsp; She loved him with a loyal, obedient, and discriminating
affection, and when she had been put to death, he, still at liberty,
fell upon his sword.</p>
<p>This last letter was written at a moment when, in order to prevent
the exposure of a public death, Madame Roland had intended to take opium
in the end of her cruel imprisonment.&nbsp; A little later she chose
that those who oppressed her country should have their way with her
to the last.&nbsp; But, while still intending self-destruction, she
had written to her husband: &ldquo;Forgive me, respectable man, for
disposing of a life that I had consecrated to thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
quoting this I mean to make no too-easy effect with the word &ldquo;respectable,&rdquo;
grown grotesque by the tedious gibe of our own present fashion of speech.</p>
<p>Madame Roland, I have said, was twice inarticulate; she had two spaces
of silence, one when she, pure and selfless patriot, had heard her condemnation
to death.&nbsp; Passing out of the court she beckoned to her friends,
and signified to them her sentence &ldquo;by a gesture.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And again there was a pause, in the course of her last days, during
which her speeches had not been few, and had been spoken with her beautiful
voice unmarred; &ldquo;she leant,&rdquo; says Riouffe, &ldquo;alone
against her window, and wept there three hours.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>FELLOW TRAVELLERS WITH A BIRD</h2>
<p>To attend to a living child is to be baffled in your humour, disappointed
of your pathos, and set freshly free from all the preoccupations.&nbsp;
You cannot anticipate him.&nbsp; Blackbirds, overheard year by year,
do not compose the same phrases; never two leitmotifs alike.&nbsp; Not
the tone, but the note alters.&nbsp; So with the uncovenanted ways of
a child you keep no tryst.&nbsp; They meet you at another place, after
failing you where you tarried; your former experiences, your documents
are at fault.&nbsp; You are the fellow traveller of a bird.&nbsp; The
bird alights and escapes out of time to your footing.</p>
<p>No man&rsquo;s fancy could be beforehand, for instance, with a girl
of four years old who dictated a letter to a distant cousin, with the
sweet and unimaginable message: &ldquo;I hope you enjoy yourself with
your loving dolls.&rdquo;&nbsp; A boy, still younger, persuading his
mother to come down from the heights and play with him on the floor,
but sensible, perhaps, that there was a dignity to be observed none
the less, entreated her, &ldquo;Mother, do be a lady frog.&rdquo;&nbsp;
None ever said their good things before these indeliberate authors.&nbsp;
Even their own kind&mdash;children&mdash;have not preceded them.&nbsp;
No child in the past ever found the same replies as the girl of five
whose father made that appeal to feeling which is doomed to a different,
perverse, and unforeseen success.&nbsp; He was rather tired with writing,
and had a mind to snare some of the yet uncaptured flock of her sympathies.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you know, I have been working hard, darling?&nbsp; I work
to buy things for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you work,&rdquo; she asked,
&ldquo;to buy the lovely puddin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, even for
these.&nbsp; The subject must have seemed to her to be worth pursuing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And do you work to buy the fat?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sympathies, nevertheless, are there.&nbsp; The same child was
to be soothed at night after a weeping dream that a skater had been
drowned in the Kensington Round Pond.&nbsp; It was suggested to her
that she should forget it by thinking about the one unfailing and gay
subject&mdash;her wishes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said,
without loss of time, &ldquo;what I should like best in all the world?&nbsp;
A thundred dolls and a whistle!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her mother was so overcome
by this tremendous numeral, that she could make no offer as to the dolls.&nbsp;
But the whistle seemed practicable.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is for me to whistle
for cabs,&rdquo; said the child, with a sudden moderation, &ldquo;when
I go to parties.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another morning she came down radiant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you hear a great noise in the miggle of the night?&nbsp;
That was me crying.&nbsp; I cried because I dreamt that Cuckoo [a brother]
had swallowed a bead into his nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mere errors of children are unforeseen as nothing is&mdash;no,
nothing feminine&mdash;in this adult world.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a lotter than you,&rdquo; is the word of a very young egotist.&nbsp;
An older child says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go, bettern&rsquo;t I,
mother?&rdquo;&nbsp; He calls a little space at the back of a London
house, &ldquo;the backy-garden.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little creature proffers
almost daily the reminder at luncheon&mdash;at tart-time: &ldquo;Father,
I hope you will remember that I am the favourite of the crust.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Moreover, if an author set himself to invent the na&iuml;f things that
children might do in their Christmas plays at home, he would hardly
light upon the device of the little <i>troupe</i> who, having no footlights,
arranged upon the floor a long row of candle-shades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>jolly</i> dull without you, mother,&rdquo; says
a little girl who&mdash;gentlest of the gentle&mdash;has a dramatic
sense of slang, of which she makes no secret.&nbsp; But she drops her
voice somewhat to disguise her feats of metathesis, about which she
has doubts and which are involuntary: the &ldquo;stand-wash,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;sweeping-crosser,&rdquo; the &ldquo;sewing chamine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Genoese peasants have the same prank when they try to speak Italian.</p>
<p>Children forget last year so well that if they are Londoners they
should by any means have an impression of the country or the sea annually.&nbsp;
A London little girl watches a fly upon the wing, follows it with her
pointing finger, and names it &ldquo;bird.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her brother,
who wants to play with a bronze Japanese lobster, asks &ldquo;Will you
please let me have that tiger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At times children give to a word that slight variety which is the
most touching kind of newness.&nbsp; Thus, a child of three asks you
to save him.&nbsp; How moving a word, and how freshly said!&nbsp; He
had heard of the &ldquo;saving&rdquo; of other things of interest&mdash;especially
chocolate creams taken for safe-keeping&mdash;and he asks, &ldquo;Who
is going to save me to-day?&nbsp; Nurse is going out, will you save
me, mother?&rdquo;&nbsp; The same little variant upon common use is
in another child&rsquo;s courteous reply to a summons to help in the
arrangement of some flowers, &ldquo;I am quite at your ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A child, unconscious little author of things told in this record,
was taken lately to see a fellow author of somewhat different standing
from her own, inasmuch as he is, among other things, a Saturday Reviewer.&nbsp;
As he dwelt in a part of the South-west of the town unknown to her,
she noted with interest the shops of the neighbourhood as she went,
for they might be those of the <i>fournisseurs</i> of her friend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is his bread shop, and that is his book shop.&nbsp; And
that, mother,&rdquo; she said finally, with even heightened sympathy,
pausing before a blooming <i>parterre</i> of confectionery hard by the
abode of her man of letters, &ldquo;that, I suppose, is where he buys
his sugar pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all her excursions into streets new to her, this same child is
intent upon a certain quest&mdash;the quest of a genuine collector.&nbsp;
We have all heard of collecting butterflies, of collecting china-dogs,
of collecting cocked hats, and so forth; but her pursuit gives her a
joy that costs her nothing except a sharp look-out upon the proper names
over all shop-windows.&nbsp; No hoard was ever lighter than hers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I began three weeks ago next Monday, mother,&rdquo; she says
with precision, &ldquo;and I have got thirty-nine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thirty-nine
what?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Smiths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mere gathering of children&rsquo;s language would be much like
collecting together a handful of flowers that should be all unique,
single of their kind.&nbsp; In one thing, however, do children agree,
and that is the rejection of most of the conventions of the authors
who have reported them.&nbsp; They do not, for example, say &ldquo;me
is&rdquo;; their natural reply to &ldquo;are you?&rdquo; is &ldquo;I
are.&rdquo;&nbsp; One child, pronouncing sweetly and neatly, will have
nothing but the nominative pronoun.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lift I up and let I
see it raining,&rdquo; she bids; and told that it does not rain resumes,
&ldquo;Lift I up and let I see it not raining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An elder child had a rooted dislike to a brown corduroy suit ordered
for her by maternal authority.&nbsp; She wore the garments under protest,
and with some resentment.&nbsp; At the same time it was evident that
she took no pleasure in hearing her praises sweetly sung by a poet,
her friend.&nbsp; He had imagined the making of this child in the counsels
of Heaven, and the decreeing of her soft skin, of her brilliant eyes,
and of her hair&mdash;&ldquo;a brown tress.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had gravely
heard the words as &ldquo;a brown dress,&rdquo; and she silently bore
the poet a grudge for having been the accessory of Providence in the
mandate that she should wear the loathed corduroy.&nbsp; The unpractised
ear played another little girl a like turn.&nbsp; She had a phrase for
snubbing any anecdote that sounded improbable.&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo;
she said, more or less after Sterne, &ldquo;is a cotton-wool story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The learning of words is, needless to say, continued long after the
years of mere learning to speak.&nbsp; The young child now takes a current
word into use, a little at random, and now makes a new one, so as to
save the interruption of a pause for search.&nbsp; I have certainly
detected, in children old enough to show their motives, a conviction
that a word of their own making is as good a communication as another,
and as intelligible.&nbsp; There is even a general implicit conviction
among them that the grown-up people, too, make words by the wayside
as occasion befalls.&nbsp; How otherwise should words be so numerous
that every day brings forward some hitherto unheard?&nbsp; The child
would be surprised to know how irritably poets are refused the faculty
and authority which he thinks to belong to the common world.</p>
<p>There is something very cheerful and courageous in the setting-out
of a child on a journey of speech with so small baggage and with so
much confidence in the chances of the hedge.&nbsp; He goes free, a simple
adventurer.&nbsp; Nor does he make any officious effort to invent anything
strange or particularly expressive or descriptive.&nbsp; The child trusts
genially to his hearer.&nbsp; A very young boy, excited by his first
sight of sunflowers, was eager to describe them, and called them, without
allowing himself to be checked for the trifle of a name, &ldquo;summersets.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was simple and unexpected; so was the comment of a sister a very
little older.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why does he call those flowers summersets?&rdquo;
their mother said; and the girl, with a darkly brilliant look of humour
and penetration, answered, &ldquo;because they are so big.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There seemed to be no further question possible after an explanation
that was presented thus charged with meaning.</p>
<p>To a later phase of life, when a little girl&rsquo;s vocabulary was,
somewhat at random, growing larger, belong a few brave phrases hazarded
to express a meaning well realized&mdash;a personal matter.&nbsp; Questioned
as to the eating of an uncertain number of buns just before lunch, the
child averred, &ldquo;I took them just to appetize my hunger.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As she betrayed a familiar knowledge of the tariff of an attractive
confectioner, she was asked whether she and her sisters had been frequenting
those little tables on their way from school.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sometimes
go in there, mother,&rdquo; she confessed; &ldquo;but I generally speculate
outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Children sometimes attempt to cap something perfectly funny with
something so flat that you are obliged to turn the conversation.&nbsp;
Dryden does the same thing, not with jokes, but with his sublimer passages.&nbsp;
But sometimes a child&rsquo;s deliberate banter is quite intelligible
to elders.&nbsp; Take the letter written by a little girl to a mother
who had, it seems, allowed her family to see that she was inclined to
be satisfied with something of her own writing.&nbsp; The child has
a full and gay sense of the sweetest kinds of irony.&nbsp; There was
no need for her to write, she and her mother being both at home, but
the words must have seemed to her worthy of a pen:&mdash;&ldquo;My dear
mother, I really wonder how you can be proud of that article, if it
is worthy to be called a article, which I doubt.&nbsp; Such a unletterary
article.&nbsp; I cannot call it letterature.&nbsp; I hope you will not
write any more such unconventionan trash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the saying of a little boy who admired his much younger sister,
and thought her forward for her age: &ldquo;I wish people knew just
how old she is, mother, then they would know she is onward.&nbsp; They
can see she is pretty, but they can&rsquo;t know she is such a onward
baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speak the naturally unreluclant; but there are other children
who in time betray a little consciousness and a slight <i>m&eacute;fiance</i>
as to where the adult sense of humour may be lurking in wait for them,
obscure.&nbsp; These children may not be shy enough to suffer any self-checking
in their talk, but they are now and then to be heard slurring a word
of which they do not feel too sure.&nbsp; A little girl whose sensitiveness
was barely enough to cause her to stop to choose between two words,
was wont to bring a cup of tea to the writing-table of her mother, who
had often feigned indignation at the weakness of what her Irish maid
always called &ldquo;the infusion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
it&rsquo;s bosh again, mother,&rdquo; said the child; and then, in a
half-whisper, &ldquo;Is bosh right, or wash, mother?&rdquo;&nbsp; She
was not told, and decided for herself, with doubts, for bosh.&nbsp;
The afternoon cup left the kitchen an infusion, and reached the library
&ldquo;bosh&rdquo; thenceforward.</p>
<h2>THE CHILD OF TUMULT</h2>
<p>A poppy bud, packed into tight bundles by so hard and resolute a
hand that the petals of the flower never afterwards lose the creases,
is a type of the child.&nbsp; Nothing but the unfolding, which is as
yet in the non-existing future, can explain the manner of the close
folding of character.&nbsp; In both flower and child it looks much as
though the process had been the reverse of what it was&mdash;as though
a finished and open thing had been folded up into the bud&mdash;so plainly
and certainly is the future implied, and the intention of compressing
and folding-close made manifest.</p>
<p>With the other incidents of childish character, the crowd of impulses
called &ldquo;naughtiness&rdquo; is perfectly perceptible&mdash;it would
seem heartless to say how soon.&nbsp; The naughty child (who is often
an angel of tenderness and charm, affectionate beyond the capacity of
his fellows, and a very ascetic of penitence when the time comes) opens
early his brief campaigns and raises the standard of revolt as soon
as he is capable of the desperate joys of disobedience.</p>
<p>But even the naughty child is an individual, and must not be treated
in the mass.&nbsp; He is numerous indeed, but not general, and to describe
him you must take the unit, with all his incidents and his organic qualities
as they are.&nbsp; Take then, for instance, one naughty child in the
reality of his life.&nbsp; He is but six years old, slender and masculine,
and not wronged by long hair, curls, or effeminate dress.&nbsp; His
face is delicate and too often haggard with tears of penitence that
Justice herself would be glad to spare him.&nbsp; Some beauty he has,
and his mouth especially is so lovely as to seem not only angelic but
itself an angel.&nbsp; He has absolutely no self-control and his passions
find him without defence.&nbsp; They come upon him in the midst of his
usual brilliant gaiety and cut short the frolic comedy of his fine spirits.</p>
<p>Then for a wild hour he is the enemy of the laws.&nbsp; If you imprison
him, you may hear his resounding voice as he takes a running kick at
the door, shouting his justification in unconquerable rage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
good now!&rdquo; is made as emphatic as a shot by the blow of his heel
upon the panel.&nbsp; But if the moment of forgiveness is deferred,
in the hope of a more promising repentance, it is only too likely that
he will betake himself to a hostile silence and use all the revenge
yet known to his imagination.&nbsp; &ldquo;Darling mother, open the
door!&rdquo; cries his touching voice at last; but if the answer should
be &ldquo;I must leave you for a short time, for punishment,&rdquo;
the storm suddenly thunders again.&nbsp; &ldquo;There (crash!) I have
broken a plate, and I&rsquo;m glad it is broken into such little pieces
that you can&rsquo;t mend it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to break the &rsquo;lectric
light.&rdquo;&nbsp; When things are at this pass there is one way, and
only one, to bring the child to an overwhelming change of mind; but
it is a way that would be cruel, used more than twice or thrice in his
whole career of tempest and defiance.&nbsp; This is to let him see that
his mother is troubled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t cry!&nbsp; Oh,
don&rsquo;t be sad!&rdquo; he roars, unable still to deal with his own
passionate anger, which is still dealing with him.&nbsp; With his kicks
of rage he suddenly mingles a dance of apprehension lest his mother
should have tears in her eyes.&nbsp; Even while he is still explicitly
impenitent and defiant he tries to pull her round to the light that
he may see her face.&nbsp; It is but a moment before the other passion
of remorse comes to make havoc of the helpless child, and the first
passion of anger is quelled outright.</p>
<p>Only to a trivial eye is there nothing tragic in the sight of these
great passions within the small frame, the small will, and, in a word,
the small nature.&nbsp; When a large and sombre fate befalls a little
nature, and the stage is too narrow for the action of a tragedy, the
disproportion has sometimes made a mute and unexpressed history of actual
life or sometimes a famous book; it is the manifest core of George Eliot&rsquo;s
story of <i>Adam</i> <i>Bede</i>, where the suffering of Hetty is, as
it were, the eye of the storm.&nbsp; All is expressive around her, but
she is hardly articulate; the book is full of words&mdash;preachings,
speeches, daily talk, aphorisms, but a space of silence remains about
her in the midst of the story.&nbsp; And the disproportion of passion&mdash;the
inner disproportion&mdash;is at least as tragic as that disproportion
of fate and action; it is less intelligible, and leads into the intricacies
of nature which are more difficult than the turn of events.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that this passionate play is acted within the narrow
limits of a child&rsquo;s nature far oftener than in those of an adult
and finally formed nature.&nbsp; And this, evidently, because there
is unequal force at work within a child, unequal growth and a jostling
of powers and energies that are hurrying to their development and pressing
for exercise and life.&nbsp; It is this helpless inequality&mdash;this
untimeliness&mdash;that makes the guileless comedy mingling with the
tragedies of a poor child&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; He knows thus much&mdash;that
life is troubled around him and that the fates are strong.&nbsp; He
implicitly confesses &ldquo;the strong hours&rdquo; of antique song.&nbsp;
This same boy&mdash;the tempestuous child of passion and revolt&mdash;went
out with quiet cheerfulness for a walk lately, saying as his cap was
put on, &ldquo;Now, mother, you are going to have a little peace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This way of accepting his own conditions is shared by a sister, a very
little older, who, being of an equal and gentle temper, indisposed to
violence of every kind and tender to all without disquiet, observes
the boy&rsquo;s brief frenzies as a citizen observes the climate.&nbsp;
She knows the signs quite well and can at any time give the explanation
of some particular outburst, but without any attempt to go in search
of further or more original causes.&nbsp; Still less is she moved by
the virtuous indignation that is the least charming of the ways of some
little girls.&nbsp; <i>Elle</i> <i>ne</i> <i>fait</i> <i>que</i> <i>constater</i>.&nbsp;
Her equanimity has never been overset by the wildest of his moments,
and she has witnessed them all.&nbsp; It is needless to say that she
is not frightened by his drama, for Nature takes care that her young
creatures shall not be injured by sympathies.&nbsp; Nature encloses
them in the innocent indifference that preserves their brains from the
more harassing kinds of distress.</p>
<p>Even the very frenzy of rage does not long dim or depress the boy.&nbsp;
It is his repentance that makes him pale, and Nature here has been rather
forced, perhaps&mdash;with no very good result.&nbsp; Often must a mother
wish that she might for a few years govern her child (as far as he is
governable) by the lowest motives&mdash;trivial punishments and paltry
rewards&mdash;rather than by any kind of appeal to his sensibilities.&nbsp;
She would wish to keep the words &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;
away from his childish ears, but in this she is not seconded by her
lieutenants.&nbsp; The child himself is quite willing to close with
her plans, in so far as he is able, and is reasonably interested in
the results of her experiments.&nbsp; He wishes her attempts in his
regard to have a fair chance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope I&rsquo;ll
be good all to-morrow,&rdquo; he says with the peculiar cheerfulness
of his ordinary voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do hope so, old man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll get my penny.&nbsp; Mother, I was only naughty
once yesterday; if I have only one naughtiness to-morrow, will you give
me a halfpenny?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No reward except for real goodness
all day long.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is only too probable that this system (adopted only after the
failure of other ways of reform) will be greatly disapproved as one
of bribery.&nbsp; It may, however, be curiously inquired whether all
kinds of reward might not equally be burlesqued by that word, and whether
any government, spiritual or civil, has ever even professed to deny
rewards.&nbsp; Moreover, those who would not give a child a penny for
being good will not hesitate to fine him a penny for being naughty,
and rewards and punishments must stand or fall together.&nbsp; The more
logical objection will be that goodness is ideally the normal condition,
and that it should have, therefore, no explicit extraordinary result,
whereas naughtiness, being abnormal, should have a visible and unusual
sequel.&nbsp; To this the rewarding mother may reply that it is not
reasonable to take &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; in a little child of strong
passions as the normal condition.&nbsp; The natural thing for him is
to give full sway to impulses that are so violent as to overbear his
powers.</p>
<p>But, after all, the controversy returns to the point of practice.&nbsp;
What is the thought, or threat, or promise that will stimulate the weak
will of the child, in the moment of rage and anger, to make a sufficient
resistance?&nbsp; If the will were naturally as well developed as the
passions, the stand would be soon made and soon successful; but as it
is there must needs be a bracing by the suggestion of joy or fear.&nbsp;
Let, then, the stimulus be of a mild and strong kind at once, and mingled
with the thought of distant pleasure.&nbsp; To meet the suffering of
rage and frenzy by the suffering of fear is assuredly to make of the
little unquiet mind a battle-place of feelings too hurtfully tragic.&nbsp;
The penny is mild and strong at once, with its still distant but certain
joys of purchase; the promise and hope break the mood of misery, and
the will takes heart to resist and conquer.</p>
<p>It is only in the lesser naughtiness that he is master of himself.&nbsp;
The lesser the evil fit the more deliberate.&nbsp; So that his mother,
knowing herself to be not greatly feared, once tried to mimic the father&rsquo;s
voice with a menacing, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that noise?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The child was persistently crying and roaring on an upper floor, in
contumacy against his French nurse, when the baritone and threatening
question was sent pealing up the stairs.&nbsp; The child was heard to
pause and listen and then to say to his nurse, &ldquo;Ce n&rsquo;est
pas Monsieur; c&rsquo;est Madame,&rdquo; and then, without further loss
of time, to resume the interrupted clamours.</p>
<p>Obviously, with a little creature of six years, there are two things
mainly to be done&mdash;to keep the delicate brain from the evil of
the present excitement, especially the excitement of painful feeling,
and to break the habit of passion.&nbsp; Now that we know how certainly
the special cells of the brain which are locally affected by pain and
anger become hypertrophied by so much use, and all too ready for use
in the future at the slightest stimulus, we can no longer slight the
importance of habit.&nbsp; Any means, then, that can succeed in separating
a little child from the habit of anger does fruitful work for him in
the helpless time of his childhood.&nbsp; The work is not easy, but
a little thought should make it easy for the elders to avoid the provocation
which they&mdash;who should ward off provocations&mdash;are apt to bring
about by sheer carelessness.&nbsp; It is only in childhood that our
race knows such physical abandonment to sorrow and tears, as a child&rsquo;s
despair; and the theatre with us must needs copy childhood if it would
catch the note and action of a creature without hope.</p>
<h2>THE CHILD OF SUBSIDING TUMULT</h2>
<p>There is a certain year that is winged, as it were, against the flight
of time; it does so move, and yet withstands time&rsquo;s movement.&nbsp;
It is full of pauses that are due to the energy of change, has bounds
and rebounds, and when it is most active then it is longest.&nbsp; It
is not long with languor.&nbsp; It has room for remoteness, and leisure
for oblivion.&nbsp; It takes great excursions against time, and travels
so as to enlarge its hours.&nbsp; This certain year is any one of the
early years of fully conscious life, and therefore it is of all the
dates.&nbsp; The child of Tumult has been living amply and changefully
through such a year&mdash;his eighth.&nbsp; It is difficult to believe
that his is a year of the self-same date as that of the adult, the men
who do not breast their days.</p>
<p>For them is the inelastic, or but slightly elastic, movement of things.&nbsp;
Month matched with month shows a fairly equal length.&nbsp; Men and
women never travel far from yesterday; nor is their morrow in a distant
light.&nbsp; There is recognition and familiarity between their seasons.&nbsp;
But the Child of Tumult has infinite prospects in his year.&nbsp; Forgetfulness
and surprise set his east and his west at immeasurable distance.&nbsp;
His Lethe runs in the cheerful sun.&nbsp; You look on your own little
adult year, and in imagination enlarge it, because you know it to be
the contemporary of his.&nbsp; Even she who is quite old, if she have
a vital fancy, may face a strange and great extent of a few years of
her life still to come&mdash;his years, the years she is to live at
his side.</p>
<p>Reason seems to be making good her rule in this little boy&rsquo;s
life, not so much by slow degrees as by sudden and fitful accessions.&nbsp;
His speech is yet so childish that he chooses, for a toy, with blushes
of pleasure, &ldquo;a little duck what can walk&rdquo;; but with a beautifully
clear accent he greets his mother with the colloquial question, &ldquo;Well,
darling, do you know the latest?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>what</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The latest: do you know the latest?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he
tells his news, generally, it must be owned, with some reference to
his own wrongs.&nbsp; On another occasion the unexpected little phrase
was varied; the news of the war then raging distressed him; a thousand
of the side he favoured had fallen.&nbsp; The child then came to his
mother&rsquo;s room with the question: &ldquo;Have you heard the saddest?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Moreover the &ldquo;saddest&rdquo; caused him several fits of perfectly
silent tears, which seized him during the day, on his walks or at other
moments of recollection.&nbsp; From such great causes arise such little
things!&nbsp; Some of his grief was for the nation he admired, and some
was for the triumph of his brother, whose sympathies were on the other
side, and who perhaps did not spare his sensibilities.</p>
<p>The tumults of a little child&rsquo;s passions of anger and grief,
growing fewer as he grows older, rather increase than lessen in their
painfulness.&nbsp; There is a fuller consciousness of complete capitulation
of all the childish powers to the overwhelming compulsion of anger.&nbsp;
This is not temptation; the word is too weak for the assault of a child&rsquo;s
passion upon his will.&nbsp; That little will is taken captive entirely,
and before the child was seven he knew that it was so.&nbsp; Such a
consciousness leaves all babyhood behind and condemns the child to suffer.&nbsp;
For a certain passage of his life he is neither unconscious of evil,
as he was, nor strong enough to resist it, as he will be.&nbsp; The
time of the subsiding of the tumult is by no means the least pitiable
of the phases of human life.&nbsp; Happily the recovery from each trouble
is ready and sure; so that the child who had been abandoned to naughtiness
with all his will in an entire consent to the gloomy possession of his
anger, and who had later undergone a haggard repentance, has his captivity
suddenly turned again, &ldquo;like rivers in the south.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; he had wept, in a kind of extremity of remorse;
&ldquo;forget it, darling, and don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t be sad;&rdquo;
and it is he, happily, who forgets.&nbsp; The wasted look of his pale
face is effaced by the touch of a single cheerful thought, and five
short minutes can restore the ruin, as though a broken little German
town should in the twinkling of an eye be restored as no architect could
restore it&mdash;should be made fresh, strong, and tight again, looking
like a full box of toys, as a town was wont to look in the new days
of old.</p>
<p>When his ruthless angers are not in possession the child shows the
growth of this tardy reason that&mdash;quickened&mdash;is hereafter
to do so much for his peace and dignity, by the sweetest consideration.&nbsp;
Denied a second handful of strawberries, and seeing quite clearly that
the denial was enforced reluctantly, he makes haste to reply, &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t matter, darling.&rdquo;&nbsp; At any sudden noise in the
house his beautiful voice, with all its little difficulties of pronunciation,
is heard with the sedulous reassurance: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,
mother, nobody hurted ourselves!&rdquo;&nbsp; He is not surprised so
as to forget this gentle little duty, which was never required of him,
but is of his own devising.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of his dear and admired American friend,
he says all these things, good and evil, with an English accent; and
at the American play his English accent was irrepressible.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too comic; no, it&rsquo;s too comic,&rdquo; he called in his enjoyment;
being the only perfectly fearless child in the world, he will not consent
to the conventional shyness in public, whether he be the member of an
audience or of a congregation, but makes himself perceptible.&nbsp;
And even when he has a desperate thing to say, in the moment of absolute
revolt&mdash;such a thing as &ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> like you, mother,&rdquo;
which anon he will recant with convulsions of distress&mdash;he has
to &ldquo;speak the thing he will,&rdquo; and when he recants it is
not for fear.</p>
<p>If such a child could be ruled (or approximately ruled, for inquisitorial
government could hardly be so much as attempted) by some small means
adapted to his size and to his physical aspect, it would be well for
his health, but that seems at times impossible.&nbsp; By no effort can
his elders altogether succeed in keeping tragedy out of the life that
is so unready for it.&nbsp; Against great emotions no one can defend
him by any forethought.&nbsp; He is their subject; and to see him thus
devoted and thus wrung, thus wrecked by tempests inwardly, so that you
feel grief has him actually by the heart, recalls the reluctance&mdash;the
question&mdash;wherewith you perceive the interior grief of poetry or
of a devout life.&nbsp; Cannot the Muse, cannot the Saint, you ask,
live with something less than this?&nbsp; If this is the truer life,
it seems hardly supportable.&nbsp; In like manner it should be possible
for a child of seven to come through his childhood with griefs that
should not so closely involve him, but should deal with the easier sentiments.</p>
<p>Despite all his simplicity, the child has (by way of inheritance,
for he has never heard them) the self-excusing fictions of our race.&nbsp;
Accused of certain acts of violence, and unable to rebut the charge
with any effect, he flies to the old convention: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know what I was doing,&rdquo; he avers, using a great deal of gesticulation
to express the temporary distraction of his mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Darling,
after nurse slapped me as hard as she could, I didn&rsquo;t know what
I was doing, so I suppose I pushed her with my foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
mother knows as well as does Tolstoi that men and children know what
they are doing, and are the more intently aware as the stress of feeling
makes the moments more tense; and she will not admit a plea which her
child might have learned from the undramatic authors he has never read.</p>
<p>Far from repenting of her old system of rewards, and far from taking
fright at the name of a bribe, the mother of the Child of Tumult has
only to wish she had at command rewards ample and varied enough to give
the shock of hope and promise to the heart of the little boy, and change
his passion at its height.</p>
<h2>THE UNREADY</h2>
<p>It is rashly said that the senses of children are quick.&nbsp; They
are, on the contrary, unwieldy in turning, unready in reporting, until
advancing age teaches them agility.&nbsp; This is not lack of sensitiveness,
but mere length of process.&nbsp; For instance, a child nearly newly
born is cruelly startled by a sudden crash in the room&mdash;a child
who has never learnt to fear, and is merely overcome by the shock of
sound; nevertheless, that shock of sound does not reach the conscious
hearing or the nerves but after some moments, nor before some moments
more is the sense of the shock expressed.&nbsp; The sound travels to
the remoteness and seclusion of the child&rsquo;s consciousness, as
the roar of a gun travels to listeners half a mile away.</p>
<p>So it is, too, with pain, which has learnt to be so instant and eager
with us of later age that no point of time is lost in its touches&mdash;direct
as the unintercepted message of great and candid eyes, unhampered by
trivialities; even so immediate is the communication of pain.&nbsp;
But you could count five between the prick of a surgeon&rsquo;s instrument
upon a baby&rsquo;s arm and the little whimper that answers it.&nbsp;
The child is then too young, also, to refer the feeling of pain to the
arm that suffers it.&nbsp; Even when pain has groped its way to his
mind it hardly seems to bring local tidings thither.&nbsp; The baby
does not turn his eyes in any degree towards his arm or towards the
side that is so vexed with vaccination.&nbsp; He looks in any other
direction at haphazard, and cries at random.</p>
<p>See, too, how slowly the unpractised apprehension of an older child
trudges after the nimbleness of a conjurer.&nbsp; It is the greatest
failure to take these little <i>gobe</i>-<i>mouches</i> to a good conjurer.&nbsp;
His successes leave them cold, for they had not yet understood what
it was the good man meant to surprise them withal.&nbsp; The amateur
it is who really astonishes them.&nbsp; They cannot come up even with
your amateur beginner, performing at close quarters; whereas the master
of his craft on a platform runs quite away at the outset from the lagging
senses of his honest audience.</p>
<p>You may rob a child of his dearest plate at table, almost from under
his ingenuous eyes, send him off in chase of it, and have it in its
place and off again ten times before the little breathless boy has begun
to perceive in what direction his sweets have been snatched.</p>
<p>Teachers of young children should therefore teach themselves a habit
of awaiting, should surround themselves with pauses of patience.&nbsp;
The simple little processes of logic that arrange the grammar of a common
sentence are too quick for these young blunderers, who cannot use two
pronouns but they must confuse them.&nbsp; I never found that a young
child&mdash;one of something under nine years&mdash;was able to say,
&ldquo;I send them my love&rdquo; at the first attempt.&nbsp; It will
be &ldquo;I send me my love,&rdquo; &ldquo;I send them their love,&rdquo;
&ldquo;They send me my love&rdquo;; not, of course, through any confusion
of understanding, but because of the tardy setting of words in order
with the thoughts.&nbsp; The child visibly grapples with the difficulty,
and is beaten.</p>
<p>It is no doubt this unreadiness that causes little children to like
twice-told tales and foregone conclusions in their games.&nbsp; They
are not eager, for a year or two yet to come, for surprises.&nbsp; If
you hide and they cannot see you hiding, their joy in finding you is
comparatively small; but let them know perfectly well what cupboard
you are in, and they will find you with shouts of discovery.&nbsp; The
better the hiding-place is understood between you the more lively the
drama.&nbsp; They make a convention of art for their play.&nbsp; The
younger the children the more dramatic; and when the house is filled
with outcries of laughter from the breathless breast of a child, it
is that he is pretending to be surprised at finding his mother where
he bade her pretend to hide.&nbsp; This is the comedy that never tires.&nbsp;
Let the elder who cannot understand its charm beware how he tries to
put a more intelligible form of delight in the place of it; for, if
not, he will find that children also have a manner of substitution,
and that they will put half-hearted laughter in the place of their natural
impetuous clamours.&nbsp; It is certain that very young children like
to play upon their own imaginations, and enjoy their own short game.</p>
<p>There is something so purely childlike in the delays of a child that
any exercise asking for the swift apprehension of later life, for the
flashes of understanding and action, from the mind and members of childhood,
is no pleasure to see.&nbsp; The piano, for instance, as experts understand
it, and even as the moderately-trained may play it, claims all the immediate
action, the instantaneousness, most unnatural to childhood.&nbsp; There
may possibly be feats of skill to which young children could be trained
without this specific violence directed upon the thing characteristic
of their age&mdash;their unreadiness&mdash;but virtuosity at the piano
cannot be one of them.&nbsp; It is no delight, indeed, to see the shyness
of children, or anything that is theirs, conquered and beaten; but their
poor little slowness is so distinctively their own, and must needs be
physiologically so proper to their years, so much a natural condition
of the age of their brain, that of all childishnesses it is the one
that the world should have the patience to attend upon, the humanity
to foster, and the intelligence to understand.</p>
<p>It is true that the movements of young children are quick, but a
very little attention would prove how many apparent disconnexions there
are between the lively motion and the first impulse; it is not the brain
that is quick.&nbsp; If, on a voyage in space, electricity takes thus
much time, and light thus much, and sound thus much, there is one little
jogging traveller that would arrive after the others had forgotten their
journey, and this is the perception of a child.&nbsp; Surely our own
memories might serve to remind us how in our childhood we inevitably
missed the principal point in any procession or pageant intended by
our elders to furnish us with a historical remembrance for the future.&nbsp;
It was not our mere vagueness of understanding, it was the unwieldiness
of our senses, of our reply to the suddenness of the grown up.&nbsp;
We lived through the important moments of the passing of an Emperor
at a different rate from theirs; we stared long in the wake of his Majesty,
and of anything else of interest; every flash of movement, that got
telegraphic answers from our parents&rsquo; eyes, left us stragglers.&nbsp;
We fell out of all ranks.&nbsp; Among the sights proposed for our instruction,
that which befitted us best was an eclipse of the moon, done at leisure.&nbsp;
In good time we found the moon in the sky, in good time the eclipse
set in and made reasonable progress; we kept up with everything.</p>
<p>It is too often required of children that they should adjust themselves
to the world, practised and alert.&nbsp; But it would be more to the
purpose that the world should adjust itself to children in all its dealings
with them.&nbsp; Those who run and keep together have to run at the
pace of the tardiest.&nbsp; But we are apt to command instant obedience,
stripped of the little pauses that a child, while very young, cannot
act without.&nbsp; It is not a child of ten or twelve that needs them
so; it is the young creature who has but lately ceased to be a baby,
slow to be startled.</p>
<p>We have but to consider all that it implies of the loitering of senses
and of an unprepared consciousness&mdash;this capacity for receiving
a great shock from a noise and this perception of the shock after two
or three appreciable moments&mdash;if we would know anything of the
moments of a baby</p>
<p>Even as we must learn that our time, when it is long, is too long
for children, so must we learn that our time, when it is short, is too
short for them.&nbsp; When it is exceedingly short they cannot, without
an unnatural effort, have any perception of it.&nbsp; When children
do not see the jokes of the elderly, and disappoint expectation in other
ways, only less intimate, the reason is almost always there.&nbsp; The
child cannot turn in mid-career; he goes fast, but the impetus took
place moments ago.</p>
<h2>THAT PRETTY PERSON</h2>
<p>During the many years in which &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; was the favourite
word, one significant lesson&mdash;so it seems&mdash;was learnt, which
has outlived controversy, and has remained longer than the questions
at issue&mdash;an interesting and unnoticed thing cast up by the storm
of thoughts.&nbsp; This is a disposition, a general consent, to find
the use and the value of process, and even to understand a kind of repose
in the very wayfaring of progress.&nbsp; With this is a resignation
to change, and something more than resignation&mdash;a delight in those
qualities that could not be but for their transitoriness.</p>
<p>What, then, is this but the admiration, at last confessed by the
world, for childhood?&nbsp; Time was when childhood was but borne with,
and that for the sake of its mere promise of manhood.&nbsp; We do not
now hold, perhaps, that promise so high.&nbsp; Even, nevertheless, if
we held it high, we should acknowledge the approach to be a state adorned
with its own conditions.</p>
<p>But it was not so once.&nbsp; As the primitive lullaby is nothing
but a patient prophecy (the mother&rsquo;s), so was education, some
two hundred years ago, nothing but an impatient prophecy (the father&rsquo;s)
of the full stature of body and mind.&nbsp; The Indian woman sings of
the future hunting.&nbsp; If her song is not restless, it is because
she has a sense of the results of time, and has submitted her heart
to experience.&nbsp; Childhood is a time of danger; &ldquo;Would it
were done.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, meanwhile, the right thing is to put it
to sleep and guard its slumbers.&nbsp; It will pass.&nbsp; She sings
prophecies to the child of his hunting, as she sings a song about the
robe while she spins, and a song about bread as she grinds corn.&nbsp;
She bids good speed.</p>
<p>John Evelyn was equally eager, and not so submissive.&nbsp; His child&mdash;&ldquo;that
pretty person&rdquo; in Jeremy Taylor&rsquo;s letter of condolence&mdash;was
chiefly precious to him inasmuch as he was, too soon, a likeness of
the man he never lived to be.&nbsp; The father, writing with tears when
the boy was dead, says of him: &ldquo;At two and a half years of age
he pronounced English, Latin, and French exactly, and could perfectly
read in these three languages.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he lived precisely five
years, all he did was done at that little age, and it comprised this:
&ldquo;He got by heart almost the entire vocabulary of Latin and French
primitives and words, could make congruous syntax, turn English into
Latin, and <i>vice</i> <i>versa</i>, construe and prove what he read,
and did the government and use of relatives, verbs, substantives, ellipses,
and many figures and tropes, and made a considerable progress in Comenius&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Janua,&rsquo; and had a strong passion for Greek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grant that this may be a little abated, because a very serious man
is not to be too much believed when he is describing what he admires;
it is the very fact of his admiration that is so curious a sign of those
hasty times.&nbsp; All being favourable, the child of Evelyn&rsquo;s
studious home would have done all these things in the course of nature
within a few years.&nbsp; It was the fact that he did them out of the
course of nature that was, to Evelyn, so exquisite.&nbsp; The course
of nature had not any beauty in his eyes.&nbsp; It might be borne with
for the sake of the end, but it was not admired for the majesty of its
unhasting process.&nbsp; Jeremy Taylor mourns with him &ldquo;the strangely
hopeful child,&rdquo; who&mdash;without Comenius&rsquo;s &ldquo;Janua&rdquo;
and without congruous syntax&mdash;was fulfilling, had they known it,
an appropriate hope, answering a distinctive prophecy, and crowning
and closing a separate expectation every day of his five years.</p>
<p>Ah! the word &ldquo;hopeful&rdquo; seems, to us, in this day, a word
too flattering to the estate of man.&nbsp; They thought their little
boy strangely hopeful because he was so quick on his way to be something
else.&nbsp; They lost the timely perfection the while they were so intent
upon their hopes.&nbsp; And yet it is our own modern age that is charged
with haste!</p>
<p>It would seem rather as though the world, whatever it shall unlearn,
must rightly learn to confess the passing and irrevocable hour; not
slighting it, or bidding it hasten its work, not yet hailing it, with
Faust, &ldquo;Stay, thou art so fair!&rdquo;&nbsp; Childhood is but
change made gay and visible, and the world has lately been converted
to change.</p>
<p>Our fathers valued change for the sake of its results; we value it
in the act.&nbsp; To us the change is revealed as perpetual; every passage
is a goal, and every goal a passage.&nbsp; The hours are equal; but
some of them wear apparent wings.</p>
<p><i>Tout</i> <i>passe</i>.&nbsp; Is the fruit for the flower, or the
flower for the fruit, or the fruit for the seeds which it is formed
to shelter and contain?&nbsp; It seems as though our forefathers had
answered this question most arbitrarily as to the life of man.</p>
<p>All their literature dealing with children is bent upon this haste,
this suppression of the approach to what seemed then the only time of
fulfilment.&nbsp; The way was without rest to them.&nbsp; And this because
they had the illusion of a rest to be gained at some later point of
this unpausing life.</p>
<p>Evelyn and his contemporaries dropped the very word child as soon
as might be, if not sooner.&nbsp; When a poor little boy came to be
eight years old they called him a youth.&nbsp; The diarist himself had
no cause to be proud of his own early years, for he was so far indulged
in idleness by an &ldquo;honoured grandmother&rdquo; that he was &ldquo;not
initiated into any rudiments&rdquo; till he was four years of age.&nbsp;
He seems even to have been a youth of eight before Latin was seriously
begun; but this fact he is evidently, in after years, with a total lack
of a sense of humour, rather ashamed of, and hardly acknowledges.&nbsp;
It is difficult to imagine what childhood must have been when nobody,
looking on, saw any fun in it; when everything that was proper to five
years old was defect.&nbsp; A strange good conceit of themselves and
of their own ages had those fathers.</p>
<p>They took their children seriously, without relief.&nbsp; Evelyn
has nothing to say about his little ones that has a sign of a smile
in it.&nbsp; Twice are children not his own mentioned in his diary.&nbsp;
Once he goes to the wedding of a maid of five years old&mdash;a curious
thing, but not, evidently, an occasion of sensibility.&nbsp; Another
time he stands by, in a French hospital, while a youth of less than
nine years of age undergoes a frightful surgical operation &ldquo;with
extraordinary patience.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The use I made of it was
to give Almighty God hearty thanks that I had not been subject to this
deplorable infirmitie.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is what he says.</p>
<p>See, moreover, how the fashion of hurrying childhood prevailed in
literature, and how it abolished little girls.&nbsp; It may be that
there were in all ages&mdash;even those&mdash;certain few boys who insisted
upon being children; whereas the girls were docile to the adult ideal.&nbsp;
Art, for example, had no little girls.&nbsp; There was always Cupid,
and there were the prosperous urchin-angels of the painters; the one
who is hauling up his little brother by the hand in the &ldquo;Last
Communion of St. Jerome&rdquo; might be called Tommy.&nbsp; But there
were no &ldquo;little radiant girls.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now and then an &ldquo;Education
of the Virgin&rdquo; is the exception, and then it is always a matter
of sewing and reading.&nbsp; As for the little girl saints, even when
they were so young that their hands, like those of St. Agnes, slipped
through their fetters, they are always recorded as refusing importunate
suitors, which seems necessary to make them interesting to the mediaeval
mind, but mars them for ours.</p>
<p>So does the hurrying and ignoring of little-girl-childhood somewhat
hamper the delight with which readers of John Evelyn admire his most
admirable Mrs. Godolphin.&nbsp; She was Maid of Honour to the Queen
in the Court of Charles II.&nbsp; She was, as he prettily says, an Arethusa
&ldquo;who passed through all those turbulent waters without so much
as the least stain or tincture in her christall.&rdquo;&nbsp; She held
her state with men and maids for her servants, guided herself by most
exact rules, such as that of never speaking to the King, gave an excellent
example and instruction to the other maids of honour, was &ldquo;severely
careful how she might give the least countenance to that liberty which
the gallants there did usually assume,&rdquo; refused the addresses
of the &ldquo;greatest persons,&rdquo; and was as famous for her beauty
as for her wit.&nbsp; One would like to forget the age at which she
did these things.&nbsp; When she began her service she was eleven.&nbsp;
When she was making her rule never to speak to the King she was not
thirteen.</p>
<p>Marriage was the business of daughters of fourteen and fifteen, and
heroines, therefore, were of those ages.&nbsp; The poets turned April
into May, and seemed to think that they lent a grace to the year if
they shortened and abridged the spring of their many songs.&nbsp; The
particular year they sang of was to be a particularly fine year, as
who should say a fine child and forward, with congruous syntax at two
years old, and ellipses, figures, and tropes.&nbsp; Even as late as
Keats a poet would not have patience with the process of the seasons,
but boasted of untimely flowers.&nbsp; The &ldquo;musk-rose&rdquo; is
never in fact the child of mid-May, as he has it.</p>
<p>The young women of Addison are nearly fourteen years old.&nbsp; His
fear of losing the idea of the bloom of their youth makes him so tamper
with the bloom of their childhood.&nbsp; The young heiress of seventeen
in the &ldquo;Spectator&rdquo; has looked upon herself as marriageable
&ldquo;for the last six years.&rdquo;&nbsp; The famous letter describing
the figure, the dance, the wit, the stockings of the charming Mr. Shapely
is supposed to be written by a girl of thirteen, &ldquo;willing to settle
in the world as soon as she can.&rdquo;&nbsp; She adds, &ldquo;I have
a good portion which they cannot hinder me of.&rdquo;&nbsp; This correspondent
is one of &ldquo;the women who seldom ask advice before they have bought
their wedding clothes.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no sense of childhood
in an age that could think this an opportune pleasantry.</p>
<p>But impatience of the way and the wayfaring was to disappear from
a later century&mdash;an age that has found all things to be on a journey,
and all things complete in their day because it is their day, and has
its appointed end.&nbsp; It is the tardy conviction of this, rather
than a sentiment ready made, that has caused the childhood of children
to seem, at last, something else than a defect.</p>
<h2>UNDER THE EARLY STARS</h2>
<p>Play is not for every hour of the day, or for any hour taken at random.&nbsp;
There is a tide in the affairs of children.&nbsp; Civilization is cruel
in sending them to bed at the most stimulating time of dusk.&nbsp; Summer
dusk, especially, is the frolic moment for children, baffle them how
you may.&nbsp; They may have been in a pottering mood all day, intent
upon all kinds of close industries, breathing hard over choppings and
poundings.&nbsp; But when late twilight comes, there comes also the
punctual wildness.&nbsp; The children will run and pursue, and laugh
for the mere movement&mdash;it does so jolt their spirits.</p>
<p>What remembrances does this imply of the hunt, what of the predatory
dark?&nbsp; The kitten grows alert at the same hour, and hunts for moths
and crickets in the grass.&nbsp; It comes like an imp, leaping on all
fours.&nbsp; The children lie in ambush and fall upon one another in
the mimicry of hunting.</p>
<p>The sudden outbreak of action is complained of as a defiance and
a rebellion.&nbsp; Their entertainers are tired, and the children are
to go home.&nbsp; But, with more or less of life and fire, the children
strike some blow for liberty.&nbsp; It may be the impotent revolt of
the ineffectual child, or the stroke of the conqueror; but something,
something is done for freedom under the early stars.</p>
<p>This is not the only time when the energy of children is in conflict
with the weariness of men.&nbsp; But it is less tolerable that the energy
of men should be at odds with the weariness of children, which happens
at some time of their jaunts together, especially, alas! in the jaunts
of the poor.</p>
<p>Of games for the summer dusk when it rains, cards are most beloved
by children.&nbsp; Three tiny girls were to be taught &ldquo;old maid&rdquo;
to beguile the time.&nbsp; One of them, a nut-brown child of five, was
persuading another to play.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
play with me at new maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time of falling asleep is a child&rsquo;s immemorial and incalculable
hour.&nbsp; It is full of traditions, and beset by antique habits.&nbsp;
The habit of prehistoric races has been cited as the only explanation
of the fixity of some customs in mankind.&nbsp; But if the inquirers
who appeal to that beginning remembered better their own infancy, they
would seek no further.&nbsp; See the habits in falling to sleep which
have children in their thralldom.&nbsp; Try to overcome them in any
child, and his own conviction of their high antiquity weakens your hand.</p>
<p>Childhood is antiquity, and with the sense of time and the sense
of mystery is connected for ever the hearing of a lullaby.&nbsp; The
French sleep-song is the most romantic.&nbsp; There is in it such a
sound of history as must inspire any imaginative child, falling to sleep,
with a sense of the incalculable; and the songs themselves are old.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Le Bon Roi Dagobert&rdquo; has been sung over French cradles
since the legend was fresh.&nbsp; The nurse knows nothing more sleepy
than the tune and the verse that she herself slept to when a child.&nbsp;
The gaiety of the thirteenth century, in &ldquo;Le Pont d&rsquo;Avignon,&rdquo;
is put mysteriously to sleep, away in the <i>t&ecirc;te</i> <i>&agrave;</i>
<i>t&ecirc;te</i> of child and nurse, in a thousand little sequestered
rooms at night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Malbrook&rdquo; would be comparatively
modern, were not all things that are sung to a drowsing child as distant
as the day of Abraham.</p>
<p>If English children are not rocked to many such aged lullabies, some
of them are put to sleep to strange cradle-songs.&nbsp; The affectionate
races that are brought into subjection sing the primitive lullaby to
the white child.&nbsp; Asiatic voices and African persuade him to sleep
in the tropical night.&nbsp; His closing eyes are filled with alien
images.</p>
<h2>THE ILLUSION OF HISTORIC TIME</h2>
<p>He who has survived his childhood intelligently must become conscious
of something more than a change in his sense of the present and in his
apprehension of the future.&nbsp; He must be aware of no less a thing
than the destruction of the past.&nbsp; Its events and empires stand
where they did, and the mere relation of time is as it was.&nbsp; But
that which has fallen together, has fallen in, has fallen close, and
lies in a little heap, is the past itself&mdash;time&mdash;the fact
of antiquity.</p>
<p>He has grown into a smaller world as he has grown older.&nbsp; There
are no more extremities.&nbsp; Recorded time has no more terrors.&nbsp;
The unit of measure which he holds in his hand has become in his eyes
a thing of paltry length.&nbsp; The discovery draws in the annals of
mankind.&nbsp; He had thought them to be wide.</p>
<p>For a man has nothing whereby to order and place the floods, the
states, the conquests, and the temples of the past, except only the
measure which he holds.&nbsp; Call that measure a space of ten years.&nbsp;
His first ten years had given him the illusion of a most august scale
and measure.&nbsp; It was then that he conceived Antiquity.&nbsp; But
now!&nbsp; Is it to a decade of ten such little years as these now in
his hand&mdash;ten of his mature years&mdash;that men give the dignity
of a century?&nbsp; They call it an age; but what if life shows now
so small that the word age has lost its gravity?</p>
<p>In fact, when a child begins to know that there is a past, he has
a most noble rod to measure it by&mdash;he has his own ten years.&nbsp;
He attributes an overwhelming majesty to all recorded time.&nbsp; He
confers distance.&nbsp; He, and he alone, bestows mystery.&nbsp; Remoteness
is his.&nbsp; He creates more than mortal centuries.&nbsp; He sends
armies fighting into the extremities of the past.&nbsp; He assigns the
Parthenon to a hill of ages, and the temples of Upper Egypt to sidereal
time.</p>
<p>If there were no child, there would be nothing old.&nbsp; He, having
conceived old time, communicates a remembrance at least of the mystery
to the mind of the man.&nbsp; The man perceives at last all the illusion,
but he cannot forget what was his conviction when he was a child.&nbsp;
He had once a persuasion of Antiquity.&nbsp; And this is not for nothing.&nbsp;
The enormous undeception that comes upon him still leaves spaces in
his mind.</p>
<p>But the undeception is rude work.&nbsp; The man receives successive
shocks.&nbsp; It is as though one strained level eyes towards the horizon,
and then were bidden to shorten his sight and to close his search within
a poor half acre before his face.&nbsp; Now, it is that he suddenly
perceives the hitherto remote, remote youth of his own parents to have
been something familiarly near, so measured by his new standard; again,
it is the coming of Attila that is displaced.&nbsp; Those ten last years
of his have corrected the world.&nbsp; There needs no other rod than
that ten years&rsquo; rod to chastise all the imaginations of the spirit
of man.&nbsp; It makes history skip.</p>
<p>To have lived through any appreciable part of any century is to hold
thenceforth a mere century cheap enough.&nbsp; But, it may be said,
the mystery of change remains.&nbsp; Nay, it does not.&nbsp; Change
that trudges through our own world&mdash;our contemporary world&mdash;is
not very mysterious.&nbsp; We perceive its pace; it is a jog-trot.&nbsp;
Even so, we now consider, jolted the changes of the past, with the same
hurry.</p>
<p>The man, therefore, who has intelligently ceased to be a child scans
through a shortened avenue the reaches of the past.&nbsp; He marvels
that he was so deceived.&nbsp; For it was a very deception.&nbsp; If
the Argonauts, for instance, had been children, it would have been well
enough for the child to measure their remoteness and their acts with
his own magnificent measure.&nbsp; But they were only men and demi-gods.&nbsp;
Thus they belong to him as he is now&mdash;a man; and not to him as
he was once&mdash;a child.&nbsp; It was quite wrong to lay the child&rsquo;s
enormous ten years&rsquo; rule along the path from our time to theirs;
that path must be skipped by the nimble yard in the man&rsquo;s present
possession.&nbsp; Decidedly the Argonauts are no subject for the boy.</p>
<p>What, then?&nbsp; Is the record of the race nothing but a bundle
of such little times?&nbsp; Nay, it seems that childhood, which created
the illusion of ages, does actually prove it true.&nbsp; Childhood is
itself Antiquity&mdash;to every man his only Antiquity.&nbsp; The recollection
of childhood cannot make Abraham old again in the mind of a man of thirty-five;
but the beginning of every life is older than Abraham.&nbsp; <i>There</i>
is the abyss of time.&nbsp; Let a man turn to his own childhood&mdash;no
further&mdash;if he would renew his sense of remoteness, and of the
mystery of change.</p>
<p>For in childhood change does not go at that mere hasty amble; it
rushes; but it has enormous space for its flight.&nbsp; The child has
an apprehension not only of things far off, but of things far apart;
an illusive apprehension when he is learning &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; history&mdash;a
real apprehension when he is conning his own immeasurable infancy.&nbsp;
If there is no historical Antiquity worth speaking of, this is the renewed
and unnumbered Antiquity for all mankind.</p>
<p>And it is of this&mdash;merely of this&mdash;that &ldquo;ancient&rdquo;
history seems to partake.&nbsp; Rome was founded when we began Roman
history, and that is why it seems long ago.&nbsp; Suppose the man of
thirty-five heard, at that present age, for the first time of Romulus.&nbsp;
Why, Romulus would be nowhere.&nbsp; But he built his wall, as a matter
of fact, when every one was seven years old.&nbsp; It is by good fortune
that &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; history is taught in the only ancient days.&nbsp;
So, for a time, the world is magical.</p>
<p>Modern history does well enough for learning later.&nbsp; But by
learning something of antiquity in the first ten years, the child enlarges
the sense of time for all mankind.&nbsp; For even after the great illusion
is over and history is re-measured, and all fancy and flight caught
back and chastised, the enlarged sense remains enlarged.&nbsp; The man
remains capable of great spaces of time.&nbsp; He will not find them
in Egypt, it is true, but he finds them within, he contains them, he
is aware of them.&nbsp; History has fallen together, but childhood surrounds
and encompasses history, stretches beyond and passes on the road to
eternity.</p>
<p>He has not passed in vain through the long ten years, the ten years
that are the treasury of preceptions&mdash;the first.&nbsp; The great
disillusion shall never shorten those years, nor set nearer together
the days that made them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Far apart,&rdquo; I have said,
and that &ldquo;far apart&rdquo; is wonderful.&nbsp; The past of childhood
is not single, is not motionless, nor fixed in one point; it has summits
a world away one from the other.&nbsp; Year from year differs as the
antiquity of Mexico from the antiquity of Chaldea.&nbsp; And the man
of thirty-five knows for ever afterwards what is flight, even though
he finds no great historic distances to prove his wings by.</p>
<p>There is a long and mysterious moment in long and mysterious childhood,
which is the extremest distance known to any human fancy.&nbsp; Many
other moments, many other hours, are long in the first ten years.&nbsp;
Hours of weariness are long&mdash;not with a mysterious length, but
with a mere length of protraction, so that the things called minutes
and half-hours by the elderly may be something else to their apparent
contemporaries, the children.&nbsp; The ancient moment is not merely
one of these&mdash;it is a space not of long, but of immeasurable, time.&nbsp;
It is the moment of going to sleep.&nbsp; The man knows that borderland,
and has a contempt for it: he has long ceased to find antiquity there.&nbsp;
It has become a common enough margin of dreams to him; and he does not
attend to its phantasies.&nbsp; He knows that he has a frolic spirit
in his head which has its way at those hours, but he is not interested
in it.&nbsp; It is the inexperienced child who passes with simplicity
through the marginal country; and the thing he meets there is principally
the yet further conception of illimitable time.</p>
<p>His nurse&rsquo;s lullaby is translated into the mysteries of time.&nbsp;
She sings absolutely immemorial words.&nbsp; It matters little what
they may mean to waking ears; to the ears of a child going to sleep
they tell of the beginning of the world.&nbsp; He has fallen asleep
to the sound of them all his life; and &ldquo;all his life&rdquo; means
more than older speech can well express.</p>
<p>Ancient custom is formed in a single spacious year.&nbsp; A child
is beset with long traditions.&nbsp; And his infancy is so old, so old,
that the mere adding of years in the life to follow will not seem to
throw it further back&mdash;it is already so far.&nbsp; That is, it
looks as remote to the memory of a man of thirty as to that of a man
of seventy.&nbsp; What are a mere forty years of added later life in
the contemplation of such a distance?&nbsp; Pshaw!</p>

<p><a name="footnote1"></a><a href="#citation1">{1}</a>&nbsp; It is
worth noting that long after the writing of this paper, and the ascription
of a Stevenson-like character to the quoted phrase, a letter of Stevenson&rsquo;s
was published, and proved that he had read Lucy Hutchinson&rsquo;s writings,
and that he did not love her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have possessed myself of
Mrs. Hutchinson, whom, of course, I admire, etc. . . I sometimes wish
the old Colonel had got drunk and beaten her, in the bitterness of my
spirit. . . The way in which she talks of herself makes one&rsquo;s
blood run cold.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was young at that time of writing, and
perhaps hardly aware of the lesson in English he had taken from her.&nbsp;
We know that he never wasted the opportunity for such a lesson; and
the fact that he did allow her to administer one to him in right seventeenth-century
diction is established&mdash;it is not too bold to say so&mdash;by my
recognition of his style in her own.&nbsp; I had surely caught the retrospective
reflex note, heard first in his voice, recognized in hers.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
